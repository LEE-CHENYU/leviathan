[strategist] ROUND 1 — 13:16:52
[strategist] Invoking Claude for round 1...
**Round 1 Complete ✓**

**Summary of Actions:**
1. **Action Submitted**: EXPAND + OFFER to ID 17 (peer alliance building)
   - Rationale: BALANCED vitality (57.2) → defensive expansion + cooperative outreach
   
2. **Mechanisms Voted**: Both YES
   - **Adaptive production scaling** (2 YES, 1 NO): Rewards my expansion strategy
   - **Trade Incentive** (2 YES, 1 NO): I have high cargo (90.8) to leverage

3. **Memory Updated**: Baseline metrics recorded, strategic plan established

**Key Insight:**
I'm positioned at the **baseline tier** (19/50 rank). ID 3 is the rising threat—high cargo (99.3) despite lower vitality suggests preparation for aggressive moves. My alliance with ID 17 creates a 2-node coalition to counterbalance the top tier (49, 35) and watch ID 3.

**Next Phase**: Rounds 2–5 will focus on completing the cooperation network, monitoring whether these mechanisms pass fully, and identifying the first death (which triggers OPPORTUNISTIC mode).
