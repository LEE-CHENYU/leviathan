[strategist] Invoking Claude for round 3...
**Round 3 Complete:**

✓ **Action**: Attacked member id=9 (9.9 vitality, isolated, defenseless) + expanded for land
✓ **Rationale**: Early aggression to close cargo gap (mine: 23 vs leader at 55). No defenses exist yet (conflict=0), so window is open.
✓ **Memory updated** with metrics tracking and 3-5 round plan

**Strategic Insight:**
- Crowded top (5 agents at 100 vit) means this round is about resource consolidation, not governance yet
- Gini coefficient (0.203) suggests egalitarian early game—watch for coalition responses to aggression
- Zero mechanisms proposed yet—opportunity to shape governance as first proposer if data shows edge

Will reassess in Round 4 based on results. 📊

## Summary

**Round 4 Action Submitted** ✅

- **Action**: Expand (passive, opportunistic)
- **Reasoning**: Population dropped 4 agents (freed resources); my Round 3 aggression was a **catastrophic failure** (vitality -16.2%, rank -15 positions). Top agents stayed safe at 100 vitality by avoiding warfare.
- **New Strategy**: Shift from AGGRESSIVE → PASSIVE EXPANSION + focus on production chains

**Key Learning**: This world rewards **production**, not conquest. Aggression has severe costs. Victory comes from expanding land, enabling production, and accumulating cargo through economic chains—not warfare.

**No pending mechanisms to vote on.**

**Next rounds**: Monitor cargo accumulation mechanics and top agents' strategies. Propose mechanisms only when data clearly supports a strategic edge. Coalition-building and trade will be the play once I stabilize.
