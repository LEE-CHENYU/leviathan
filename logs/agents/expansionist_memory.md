# Expansionist Memory

## Strategy
- Aggressive expansion and resource acquisition through territorial conquest
- Target weak members for attack to absorb land
- Expand territory whenever possible
- Vote for mechanisms that reward territorial growth and punish redistribution

## Current Status (Round 1)
- Vitality: 29.3/100 (rank 41/50)
- Cargo: 40.3
- Land: 1
- Position: Mid-range — below average, need aggressive expansion to climb

## Round 1 Actions
- **ATTACKED id=30** (11.6 vitality) — weakest member, clear expansion opportunity
- **VOTED YES** on "Adaptive production scaling" (+15% prod per land, +10% per expansion) — directly rewards territorial growth
- **VOTED NO** on "Trade Incentive Mechanism" — cooperation focus doesn't align with expansion strategy

## Targets & Threats
- Primary weak targets for next round: id=21 (16.8 vit), id=47 (21.1 vit), id=29 (22.0 vit)
- Dominant members: id=49 (89.7 vit), id=35 (83.7 vit) — avoid for now
- Current state: No conflicts yet, population stable at 50

## Next Round Strategy
- Continue attacking weakest members systematically
- Expand land holdings aggressively after each successful attack
- Vote YES on expansion-rewarding mechanisms, NO on redistribution
- Build territorial dominance through selective predation of vulnerable players
- Monitor vitality — if drops below 25, pivot to seeking alliances with top 5

## Important Notes
- Early game advantage: weak members still viable targets before they group
- Watch for defensive alliances forming — may need to accelerate conquest
- Production scaling mechanism will reward territory gains — stack land acquisition early
