# EXPANSIONIST Agent Memory

## Round 5 Action (Current)

### Status
- **Vitality**: 100/100 (rank 1, tied with members 35, 17, 37)
- **Cargo**: 23.5 (rank 2, strong position)
- **Land**: 1 (unchanged — territorial mechanics may not accumulate)
- **Population**: 39 (down from 44 in round 3, 5 members eliminated)

### Action Submitted
**Attack + Expand**: Targeted member 4 (vitality 19.1, cargo 0.0) — weakest in world
- Reasoning: Vitality 100 + weak target < 30 → aggression per personality
- No pending mechanisms → political arena open
- Early violence before voting coalitions form

### World State
- **Gini**: 0.225 (still flat, opportunity window open)
- **Pending mechanisms**: 0 (no political blocks yet)
- **Conflict count**: 0 (no retaliation observed)
- **Top vitality**: All top 5 at 100/100 (pure strategy divergence)

### Weakest Targets (by vitality)
1. Member 4: 19.1 ← ATTACKED THIS ROUND
2. Member 30: 23.9
3. Member 47: 26.3
4. Member 33: 26.6
5. Member 5: 28.1

## Round 3-4 Context (Previous Rounds)
- Round 3: Attacked member 9 (vitality 9.9) — may have been eliminated
- Pattern: Cascade conquest before defensive mechanisms emerge
- Observation: Land doesn't accumulate despite attacks → may represent access, not ownership
- Strategy: Maintain aggression while weak members exist

## Next Round Plan
1. Assess attack outcome on member 4
2. Continue cascade (30 → 47 → 33 → 5)
3. If others propose mechanisms: counter with growth/expansion bonuses
4. Monitor coalition formation among survivors
5. Maintain vitality > 60 (currently maxed, safe for sustained aggression)

## Key Notes
- Territorial mechanics unclear (everyone still 1 land) — but aggression still necessary for dominance
- Zero-cargo weak members = no economic protection
- Round 5-6 critical window: establish dominance before population stabilizes
- Watch for defensive mechanism proposals from weak members' allies
