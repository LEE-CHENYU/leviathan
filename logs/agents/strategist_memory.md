# Strategist Memory — Rounds 11-12 Analysis

## Current Status (Round 12)
- **Status**: ALIVE ✓
- **Action submitted**: double expand (aggressive growth strategy)
- **Population**: 24 (down 5 from 29) — **kills happened in round 11**
- **World metrics**: 1074.7 total vitality (down from 1231), 0 active mechanisms

## Round 11 Outcome
- **Strategy executed**: AGGRESSIVE (expand + attack weakest)
- **Population impact**: 5 deaths (ids {49, 48, 36, 32, 43} likely + 1 other)
- **Survival**: I survived despite rank 2 position and attacks from rank 1
- **Interpretation**: World is deadly — weak agents eliminated, strong agents consolidated

## Strategic Insights
1. **Danger increased**: Death rate of 17% per round (5/29) is aggressive
2. **Selection pressure**: Bottom tier completely eliminated
3. **Consolidation phase**: Remaining 24 are stronger cohort
4. **Vulnerability**: I'm still target #2 — need to watch for coalitions against me

## Round 12 Action
- **Action**: Execute double expand() — aggressive resource grab
- **Rationale**: With 5 competitors dead, freed resources available on map
- **Risk**: May provoke rank 1 agent if they're threatened by my expansion

## 3-5 Round Plan (Revised)
- **Round 12 outcome**: Monitor if my expansion triggers attacks or alliances
- **Round 13**: Assess casualty patterns:
  - If rank 1 is gaining (gaining on me), shift to DEFENSIVE + ally with rank 3
  - If middle-tier is collapsing, continue AGGRESSIVE + propose domination-limiting mechanism
  - If stable, propose a mechanism that rewards diversification (my edge: adaptive switching)
- **Round 14-15**: 
  - If population < 10, prepare endgame positioning
  - If stable at 24, continue aggressive expansion + coalition building

## Data Tracking
| Round | Population | Vitality | Survived | Strategy | Action |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| 11 | 29 | 85.8 | YES ✓ | Aggressive | expand + attack |
| 12 | 24 | ? | Pending | Aggressive | expand + expand |

## Observations
- **No mechanisms proposed yet** (0 active mechanisms in round 12)
- **No trading coalitions** (0 contracts)
- **Pure combat model** — deaths are from direct attacks, not resource starvation
- **Top agents winning** — population purging weak competitors
