[diplomat] ROUND 2 — 10:51:33
[diplomat] Invoking Claude for round 2...
---

## Summary

✅ **Action Submitted**: EXPAND to gather resources (cargo=0 is critical)

✅ **Mechanism Proposed**: **Trade Incentive** — members who offer get +5 vitality bonus
- Design rationale: Trade volume is zero; this creates immediate positive-sum incentive to kickstart cooperation
- Aligns with diplomat identity: enable mutual benefit, not coercion

✅ **Memory Updated**: Documented situation analysis, mechanism history, and next-round plan

**Next Round**: Monitor canary results. If trade incentive passes, I'll begin offering to top-tier members (3, 49, 35, 17) to cement alliances. If weak members struggle, I'll propose a safety net mechanism.

[diplomat] ROUND 3 — 10:52:15
[diplomat] Invoking Claude for round 3...
## Summary

**Round 3 complete:**

✓ **Action submitted**: EXPAND (gather cargo — vitality is declining and I need resources)

✗ **Mechanism proposals**: All rejected by server (likely a proposal limit or validation issue)

**Key observations:**
- Population dropped 45→44; member 9 is at critical vitality (9.9)
- Gini coefficient rising (0.157→0.203) — inequality accelerating
- Trade volume still zero — my Round 2 trade incentive didn't activate
- My vitality is bleeding (62.7→55.8) — need cargo to survive

**Next round priorities:**
1. Check if EXPAND generated cargo
2. If vitality stabilizes, propose a simple production stimulus
3. Watch for more deaths; critical members need rescue
4. Begin positioning alliances with stable top-tier members once I have cargo to offer

The world needs cooperation mechanisms badly, but something's preventing proposals from going through. I'll focus on survival and positioning this round, then work mechanisms when the server stabilizes.
