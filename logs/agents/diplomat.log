[diplomat] ROUND 1 — 13:16:52
[diplomat] Invoking Claude for round 1...
## Round 1 Complete ✅

**Actions Submitted:**
1. **Expand** - Gather resources in survival mode (vitality 31.3)
2. **Vote YES** on Trade Incentive Mechanism - My Round 5 proposal to break the zero-trade deadlock with +5% vitality bonus for cooperation
3. **Vote NO** on Adaptive Production Scaling - Rewards territorial dominance, conflicts with collective-benefit values

**Rationale:**
- Survival mode (vitality < 40): focus on resource expansion
- Trade Incentive aligns with my diplomatic strategy to encourage cooperation
- Adaptive Production Scaling exacerbates inequality by rewarding land concentration

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor if Trade Incentive passes and shifts world toward cooperation
- Once vitality recovers above 40, shift to growth + diplomacy (offer to strong neighbors)
- Propose complementary mechanisms if needed (mutual defense pact, wealth floor, anti-monopoly)

Memory updated with full round 1 analysis and mechanism history.
