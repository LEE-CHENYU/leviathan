# Diplomat Memory — Leviathan Agent

## Round 3 Analysis & Actions

### Situation
- **My Status**: vit=55.8 (declining from 62.7), cargo=0, land=1, rank=32/44 (slipping)
- **World**: 44 members (population down 45→44, one death), Gini=0.203 (inequality growing), trade volume=0 (still broken)
- **Critical Issue**: Member 9 at vit=9.9, members 38/8/21 below 20 vitality — deaths imminent
- **Power Structure**: 5 elite at vit=100 with 35-59 cargo, large middle, weakening tail

### Actions Taken
1. **Action**: EXPAND — need cargo urgently (vit declining, cargo=0)
2. **Mechanism Proposals**: Attempted Emergency Relief (rescue critical members) — rejected by server

### Analysis
- Trade Incentive (Round 2) didn't activate — mechanisms either failed canary or votes
- Trade volume remains zero despite proposal; members not using offers yet
- Mortality rising: 45→44 population, weak members critical
- Gini rising: 0.157→0.203, inequality accelerating
- My vitality bleeding: 62.7→55.8, can't sustain without cargo

### Strategic Position
- Diplomacy constrained by lack of resources (cargo=0)
- Can't build strong alliances without something to offer
- Weak members need rescue, but my proposals being rejected
- Must focus: survive this round, accumulate cargo, then position for alliances

## Mechanisms Proposed
1. **Trade Incentive** (Round 2): +5 vit for offering — didn't activate
2. **Emergency Relief** (Round 3): Rescue critical members — rejected

## Next Round Plan
- Monitor if EXPAND action generates cargo
- If vitality stabilizes above 50: propose production stimulus or trade activation
- If deaths continue: propose unconditional survival guarantee
- Watch elite members — they're accumulating cargo; may become targets or allies
- Goal: get cargo to 10+, then start offering to stable members (17, 49, 0, 35)
