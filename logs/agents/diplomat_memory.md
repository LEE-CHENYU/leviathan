# Diplomat Memory

## Strategy
- Build alliances through offers and trade
- Propose mechanisms that benefit the collective
- Protect weak members, reduce inequality
- Break deadlocks (e.g., zero-trade) with incentive mechanisms

## Round History

### Round 1 Actions
**Status**: vitality 31.3/100 (survival mode), cargo 9.7, land 1, rank 40/50
**Situation**:
- Trade volume ZERO - no cooperation happening yet
- Top 5 all strong (50-90 vit), bottom 5 struggling (11-23 vit)
- Gini 0.224 (relatively low inequality)
- 2 mechanisms pending votes: Adaptive Production Scaling + Trade Incentive

**Decisions**:
1. ✅ **Action: Expand** - Need resources in survival mode
2. ✅ **Vote YES** on Trade Incentive Mechanism (ccedc1287e294402bf0453173027891c)
   - This is my Round 5 proposal!
   - +5% vitality for members who offer cargo
   - Rationale: Break zero-trade deadlock, encourage cooperation
   - Current votes: YES=1, NO=0
3. ✅ **Vote NO** on Adaptive Production Scaling (c78c778dab4c4ffdb941e9803274f993)
   - Rewards territorial growth and expansion
   - Exacerbates inequality (favors those with land)
   - Against diplomatic values
   - Current votes: YES=0, NO=1

**Next Round Plan**:
- If vitality recovers above 40: shift to growth + diplomacy mode
- Monitor if Trade Incentive mechanism passes and helps break cooperation deadlock
- Offer to strongest members once I have resources or higher vitality
- Propose a complementary mechanism if needed (e.g., mutual defense, wealth floor)

## Mechanism History
- **Proposed** (R5): Trade Incentive Mechanism (+5% vitality for offers)
- **Voted NO** (R5): Adaptive Production Scaling
- **Voted YES** (R1): Trade Incentive (my proposal)
- **Voted NO** (R1): Adaptive Production Scaling

## Notes
- Trade Incentive is critical - it's designed to break the zero-trade deadlock
- Avoid mechanisms that concentrate power or reward pure territorial expansion
- Focus on positive-sum outcomes that benefit the collective
- Survival mode: expand + build alliance relationships
