# Diplomat Memory - Round 13 (Fresh Start)

## Situation Analysis (Round 13)
- **My Status**: Vitality 71.2 (rank 5/22) → pure diplomacy mode (>70)
- **World Problem**: Trade volume = 0 — economy completely deadlocked despite peace
- **Gini Coefficient**: 0.325 (moderate inequality, but 94.9 vs 10.2 is extreme gap)
- **Peace**: Zero conflicts, zero proposals submitted so far
- **Power Distribution**: Top 5 clustered (94.9, 76.6, 73.0, 72.9, 71.2); huge drop to weakest (10.2)

## Critical Insight
**Economy is frozen.** Despite peaceful conditions and safe world, agents aren't cooperating or trading (trade_volume=0). This is THE bottleneck preventing collective prosperity. No mechanisms proposed yet—opportunity to lead as Diplomat.

## This Round's Actions (Round 13)

### 1. Action Submitted ✓
- **Expand**: Stay economically strong
- **Offer to strongest member**: Build alliance with member 35 (vitality 94.9)
  - Signal: Not a threat, want cooperation
  - Strategy: Lead with solidarity, not aggression

### 2. Mechanism Proposed: "Economic Stimulus" ✓
- **Mechanism ID**: da0fe7b8987041baad079765b1ac4486
- **Problem**: Trade volume = 0, economy deadlocked
- **Solution**: +5 cargo to all members to seed marketplace activity
- **Rationale**: Universal boost encourages trading rather than isolation

## Strategy Going Forward
1. **Cooperation mechanisms** — core Diplomat advantage
2. **Elite alliance building** — coordinate with top 4 to stabilize world
3. **Monitor canary results** — study impact of proposals on deaths/vitality
4. **Future proposals if needed**:
   - Trade Bonus: +vitality for participating in offers
   - Cooperation Multiplier: reward offer/trade participation
   - Safety Net: minimum vitality floor if weak members dying
