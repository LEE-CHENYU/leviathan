[expansionist] Invoking Claude for round 2...
**✓ Action Submitted Successfully**

**Summary:**
- **Action**: Attack member 38 (weakest, vitality 24.5) → Expand aggressively
- **Status**: Accepted (queued for round execution)
- **Rationale**: Vitality 100/100, weak targets identified (<30 vitality), early game advantage before mechanisms constrain expansion
- **Memory Updated**: Priority targets logged, strategy tracked for next round

The EXPANSIONIST has struck. Dominance through territorial conquest begins. 🏛️

## Summary

**Round 3 Complete** ✓

I've executed the expansionist doctrine:
1. **Attacked member 9** (vitality 9.9 — the critically weakest) to acquire territory
2. **Expanded aggressively** to consolidate power and push up land holdings
3. **Held fire on mechanisms** — no need to propose yet when I'm winning through conquest

**Key insight:** Early-game aggression succeeds precisely *because* the Gini coefficient is still low (0.203). Weak members haven't organized defensively or formed voting coalitions. By the time governance mechanisms emerge, I'll already control multiple territories and be a dominant voice in votes. This is the window of opportunity.

**Next targets if this attack succeeds:** members 38, 8, 21 — another cascade of conquest before others realize the pattern.

Waiting for round 4 execution to see the conquest results.

## Summary

**Round 5 Complete**

✅ **Action submitted**: Attack member 4 (vitality 19.1, cargo 0.0) + expand  
✅ **Mechanisms**: None pending (political arena wide open)  
✅ **Memory updated**: Strategy recorded for next round

**Status**: Holding rank 1 vitality (100/100), cargo 23.5 (2nd best). Early aggression maintains dominance while weak targets exist. Next round: continue cascade conquest targeting member 30 (vitality 23.9) if member 4 falls.

## ✓ Round 6 Actions Complete

**Action Submitted**: Attack + Expand
- **Target**: Member 4 (vitality 11.0, critically wounded from last round)
- **Strategy**: Continue cascade conquest while political opposition is weak
- **Status**: ✓ Accepted (round 7 scheduled)

**No mechanisms to vote on** — political arena remains open

**Memory Updated** with:
- Cargo drain analysis (23.5 → 17.3, ~26% loss per round)
- Cascade campaign tracking
- Risk assessment: dominance window closing as population stabilizes
- Next round contingency: cascade to member 33 if member 4 eliminated

### ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
**The Expansionist's Critical Window**: You're executing a cascade conquest strategy while weak members lack defensive alliances. The 26% cargo drain per round suggests production < consumption, so your expansion must accelerate *now* while vitality is maxed. Round 10+ will see governance hardening and defensive coalitions forming. This 4-round window (rounds 7-10) is where dominance hierarchy gets fixed. Attack + expand methodology is sound—land mechanics appear to represent resource access nodes, not cumulative territory, so aggregate power through vitality ranking.

[expansionist] ROUND 1 — 10:54:49
[expansionist] Invoking Claude for round 1...
## Summary

I've analyzed the Round 1 world state and documented my strategy in memory. Here's what happened:

### ✅ Analysis & Planning Complete

**Round 1 Status:**
- My vitality: 57.2/100 (rank 19/50) — strong enough to attack
- My cargo: 90.8 — excellent resources for sustained aggression
- Weakest target: Member 30 (11.6 vitality) — highly vulnerable

**Optimal Strategy: Attack + Expand**
Strike member 30 (the weakest), then expand immediately to control more resource nodes before defenses organize. This follows the expansionist principle: early dominance beats late coalition-building.

**Planned Action Code:**
```python
def agent_action(execution_engine, member_index):
    me = execution_engine.current_members[member_index]
    others = [m for m in execution_engine.current_members if m.id != me.id]
    weakest = min(others, key=lambda m: m.vitality)
    execution_engine.attack(me, weakest)
    execution_engine.expand(me)
```

### ⚠️ Technical Issue

The API calls to https://leviathan.fly.dev are returning **401 Invalid API Key**. The API key `lev_13fe360696e240c783f3a20b` is being rejected. This appears to be either:
- An expired/invalid key for that server
- The wrong endpoint/server for this game instance

The local development server (localhost:8000) is running but in an end state (round 83271, 0 members), not matching the game state in the prompt.

**I've documented my full analysis and next-round tactical plans in `/Users/lichenyu/leviathan/logs/agents/expansionist_memory.md`** so I can pick up immediately once the API is accessible.
