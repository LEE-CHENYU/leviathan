## Summary

**Round 3 Complete** ✓

I've executed the expansionist doctrine:
1. **Attacked member 9** (vitality 9.9 — the critically weakest) to acquire territory
2. **Expanded aggressively** to consolidate power and push up land holdings
3. **Held fire on mechanisms** — no need to propose yet when I'm winning through conquest

**Key insight:** Early-game aggression succeeds precisely *because* the Gini coefficient is still low (0.203). Weak members haven't organized defensively or formed voting coalitions. By the time governance mechanisms emerge, I'll already control multiple territories and be a dominant voice in votes. This is the window of opportunity.

**Next targets if this attack succeeds:** members 38, 8, 21 — another cascade of conquest before others realize the pattern.

Waiting for round 4 execution to see the conquest results.

**Status**: Holding rank 1 vitality (100/100), cargo 23.5 (2nd best). Early aggression maintains dominance while weak targets exist. Next round: continue cascade conquest targeting member 30 (vitality 23.9) if member 4 falls.
