[expansionist] ROUND 1 — 13:16:52
[expansionist] Invoking Claude for round 1...
**Round 1 Actions Complete**

✅ **Action Submitted:** Attacked id=30 (vitality 11.6) — the weakest member is the clearest expansion opportunity. This will test my combat capability and potentially seize territory.

✅ **Votes Recorded:**
- **YES** on Adaptive Production Scaling (rewards expansion directly)
- **NO** on Trade Incentive (doesn't align with territorial growth strategy)

✅ **Memory Updated:** Logged strategy, ranked targets for next round (id=21, id=47, id=29 as secondary weak targets), and set course for systematic territorial conquest.

**Strategic Positioning:** Starting at rank 41/50 with mid-range vitality means I need early aggression before stronger players solidify alliances. The production scaling mechanism will compound land advantages—seizing territory now pays exponential dividends if it passes.
