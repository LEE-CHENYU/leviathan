Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\nCurrent status (features of all members):\n{features}\n\nRelationship summary (parsed from relationship_dict):\n{relations}\n\nCode Memory and Previous Performance:\n{code_memory}\n\nPerformance history:\n{past_performance}\n\nBased on the previous code performance, adapt and improve the strategy.\nIf a previous strategy worked well (high performance), consider building upon it.\nIf it failed, try a different approach.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not simply copy the example implementation below. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique approach combining different methods and strategies in novel ways.\nConsider novel combinations of different approaches rather than following this exact pattern.\n\n[Social Strategies]\nConsider these social strategies:\n- Design systems for resource distribution and allocation\n- Build alliances and cooperative networks \n- Create mechanisms for collective decision making\n- Establish norms and rules for interaction\n- Develop methods for conflict resolution\n\n[Communication Strategy]\nYou can communicate with multiple members in a single round using:\nexecution_engine.send_message(your_id, recipient_id, \"message\")\nExample usage:\n- Broadcast to all: \n  for recipient in range(len(execution_engine.current_members)):\n      if recipient != your_id:\n          execution_engine.send_message(your_id, recipient, \"Let's cooperate!\")\n- Message allies:\n  for ally_id in ally_list:\n      execution_engine.send_message(your_id, ally_id, \"Attack target X\")\n- Group coordination:\n  for member_id in coalition:\n      execution_engine.send_message(your_id, member_id, \"Vote YES on proposal\")\n\n[Received Messages]\nNo messages received\n\nIMPORTANT: Agents should implement solutions according to their individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances.\n\n[Part 2]\n            {part0}\n            You can also propose plausible modifications to the game mechanics themselves, such as:\n        - Adding new resource types or currencies\n        - Creating new actions or interaction types\n        - Implementing voting systems or governance structures\n        - Defining property rights and ownership rules\n        - Adding social status or reputation systems\n        - Creating markets or trading mechanisms\n        - Defining new win conditions or goals\n        \n        [Social System Design]\n        Example modifications:\n        def pre_init_hook(island):\n            # Set up basic income system\n            island.basic_income = 10.0\n            island.tax_rate = 0.2\n            \n        def modify_member(member, relationships):\n            # Add social status and rights\n            member.social_rank = 0\n            member.voting_power = 1\n            member.tax_paid = 0\n            member.benefits_received = 0\n            return member\n            \n        def modify_land(land, members):\n            # Create communal lands\n            land.communal_areas = []\n            land.private_areas = []\n            return land\n            \n        def modify_relationships(relationships):\n            # Add social bonds\n            relationships['alliance'] = np.zeros_like(relationships['victim'])\n            relationships['trade_history'] = np.zeros_like(relationships['victim'])\n            return relationships\n\nIMPORTANT: Agents should implement solutions according to their individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances.\n\n[Part 3]\n            {part0}\n             [Survival-Centric Adaptation]\n        Implement systems focused on:\n        1.

Agents should implement solutions according to their individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances while leveraging these guidelines:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCurrent integrated prompt:\n[Integrated Prompt]\n\n[Previous code execution context]\n{error_context}\n\n[Current task]\nYou are member_{member.id} in a society that you can help shape.\nWrite a Python function named agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) that implements your vision of social organization while ensuring your survival.\n\n[Critical constraints]\n- Carefully analyze previous errors shown above and avoid repeating them\n- Never target yourself (member_{member.id}) in any action\n- Verify that a member has land before using the bear() action\n- Check that member IDs exist before referencing them\n- Ensure all matrix indices are valid\n- current_members is a LIST accessed by index, not a dictionary\n- Access members using execution_engine.current_members[index]\n- Check if an index exists: if index < len(execution_engine.current_members)\n\nIMPORTANT: Here are the attributes and methods actually available:\n\n1) Each member object has:\n   \u2022 member.id (int): The unique ID for the member\n   \u2022 member.vitality (float)\n   \u2022 member.cargo (float)\n   \u2022 member.overall_productivity (float)\n   \u2022 member.age (float)\n   \u2022 member.current_clear_list (List[int]) - IDs of neighbors or cleared adjacents\n\n2) The relationships are stored in execution_engine.relationship_dict, NOT in \"relationship_history\".\n   Use the arrays in relationship_dict, or rely on the summary below (the 'relations' variable).\n   The keys are: 'victim', 'benefit', 'benefit_land'.\n   Example usage:\n       matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n       # matrix[i, j] indicates how many times member_i was attacked by member_j (if > 0).\n\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method is used to produce a summary of relationships as a list of strings.\n   For example, 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)'.\n\n4) You can use these methods on execution_engine:\n   \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2, True) - Offers resources\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2, True) - Offers land\n   \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) - Bears offspring\n   \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1, member2) - Expands territory\n\n5) The members are accessed by execution_engine.current_members[id].\n   For example, execution_engine.current_members[2] for the member with ID=2.\n\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'. Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\nCurrent status (features of all members):\n{features}\n\nRelationship summary (parsed from relationship_dict):\n{relations}\n\nCode Memory and Previous Performance:\n{code_memory}\n\nPerformance history:\n{past_performance}\n\nBased on the previous code performance, adapt and improve the strategy.\nIf a previous strategy worked well (high performance), consider building upon it.\nIf it failed, try a different approach.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not simply copy the example implementation below. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique approach combining different methods and strategies in novel ways.\n\n[Social Strategies]\nConsider these social strategies:\n- Design systems for resource distribution and allocation\n- Build alliances and cooperative networks \n- Create mechanisms for collective decision making\n- Establish norms and rules for interaction\n- Develop methods for conflict resolution\n\n[Communication Strategy]\nYou can communicate with multiple members in a single round using:\nexecution_engine.send_message(your_id, recipient_id, \"message\")\nExample usage:\n- Broadcast to all: \n  for recipient in range(len(execution_engine.current_members)):\n      if recipient != your_id:\n          execution_engine.send_message(your_id, recipient, \"Let's cooperate!\")\n- Message allies:\n  for ally_id in ally_list:\n      execution_engine.send_message(your_id, ally_id, \"Attack target X\")\n- Group coordination:\n  for member_id in coalition:\n      execution_engine.send_message(your_id, member_id, \"Vote YES on proposal\")\n\n[Received Messages]\nFrom member_2: Let's build a cooperative network and share resources!\nFrom member_3: Let's cooperate for mutual benefit and survival.\n\nRemember that each agent should implement solutions according to their individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances. Adapt your strategy by leveraging available methods, ensuring robust error checks and smart interactions with members based on your unique perspective of social organization.\n\n[Part 2]\n            {part0}\n            You can also propose plausible modifications to the game mechanics themselves, such as:\n        - Adding new resource types or currencies\n        - Creating new actions or interaction types\n        - Implementing voting systems or governance structures\n        - Defining property rights and ownership rules\n        - Adding social status or reputation systems\n        - Creating markets or trading mechanisms\n        - Defining new win conditions or goals\n        \n[Social System Design]\nExample modifications:\ndef pre_init_hook(island):\n    # Set up basic income system\n    island.basic_income = 10.0\n    island.tax_rate = 0.2\n    \ndef modify_member(member, relationships):\n    # Add social status and rights\n    member.social_rank = 0\n    member.voting_power = 1\n    member.tax_paid = 0\n    member.benefits_received = 0\n    return member\n    \ndef modify_land(land, members):\n    # Create communal lands\n    land.communal_areas = []\n    land.private_areas = []\n    return land\n    \ndef modify_relationships(relationships):\n    # Add social bonds\n    relationships['alliance'] = np.zeros_like(relationships['victim'])\n    relationships['trade_history'] = np.zeros_like(relationships['victim'])\n    return relationships\n\n[Part 3 \u2013 Survival-Centric Adaptation]\nIn addition to the above, implement systems focused on:\n1.

Create personal health monitoring systems\n2. Develop egocentric threat models\n3. Optimize actions for caloric ROI\n4. Implement fail-deadly safeguards\n5.

        "final_prompt": "--------------------------------------------------\n[Previous code execution context]\n{error_context}\n\n[Current task]\nYou are member_{member.id} in a society that you can help shape.\nWrite a Python function named agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) that implements your vision of social organization while ensuring your survival.\n\n[Critical constraints]\n- Carefully analyze previous errors shown above and avoid repeating them\n- Never target yourself (member_{member.id}) in any action\n- Verify member has land before using bear() action\n- Check member IDs exist before referencing them\n- Ensure all matrix indices are valid\n- current_members is a LIST accessed by index, not a dictionary\n- Access members using execution_engine.current_members[index]\n- Check if index exists: if index < len(execution_engine.current_members)\n\nIMPORTANT: Here are the attributes and methods actually available:\n\n1) Each member object has:\n    \u2022 member.id (int): The unique ID for the member\n    \u2022 member.vitality (float)\n    \u2022 member.cargo (float)\n    \u2022 member.overall_productivity (float)\n    \u2022 member.age (float)\n    \u2022 member.current_clear_list (List[int]) - IDs of neighbors or cleared adjacents\n2) The relationships are stored in execution_engine.relationship_dict, NOT in \"relationship_history\".\n   Use the arrays in relationship_dict, or rely on the summary below (the 'relations' variable).\n   The keys are: 'victim', 'benefit', 'benefit_land'.\n   Example usage:\n       matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n       # matrix[i, j] indicates how many times member_i was attacked by member_j (if > 0).\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method is used to produce a summary of relationships as a list of strings.\n   For example, 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)'.\n4) You can use these methods on execution_engine:\n    \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2, True) - Offers resources\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2, True) - Offers land\n    \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) - Bears offspring\n    \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1, member2) - Expands territory\n5) The members are accessed by execution_engine.current_members[id].\n   For example, execution_engine.current_members[2] for the member with ID=2.\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'. Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\nCurrent status (features of all members):\n{features}\n\nRelationship summary (parsed from relationship_dict):\n{relations}\n\nCode Memory and Previous Performance:\n{code_memory}\n\nPerformance history:\n{past_performance}\n\nBased on the previous code performance, adapt and improve the strategy.\nIf a previous strategy worked well (high performance), consider building upon it.\nIf it failed, try a different approach.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not simply copy the example implementation below. Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique approach combining different methods and strategies in novel ways.\n\nConsider novel combinations of different approaches rather than following this exact pattern.\n\n[Social Strategies]\nConsider these social strategies:\n- Design systems for resource distribution and allocation\n- Build alliances and cooperative networks \n- Create mechanisms for collective decision making\n- Establish norms and rules for interaction\n- Develop methods for conflict resolution\n\n[Communication Strategy]\nYou can communicate with multiple members in a single round using:\nexecution_engine.send_message(your_id, recipient_id, \"message\")\nExample usage:\n- Broadcast to all: \n  for recipient in range(len(execution_engine.current_members)):\n      if recipient != your_id:\n          execution_engine.send_message(your_id, recipient, \"Let's cooperate!\")\n- Message allies:\n  for ally_id in ally_list:\n      execution_engine.send_message(your_id, ally_id, \"Attack target X\")\n- Group coordination:\n  for member_id in coalition:\n      execution_engine.send_message(your_id, member_id, \"Vote YES on proposal\")\n\n[Received Messages]\nFrom member_1: Let's collaborate for mutual benefit and social stability.\nFrom member_2: Let's build a cooperative network and share resources!\nFrom member_3: Let's cooperate for mutual benefit and survival.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Constraints and New Section (Part 2):\n{part0}\nYou can also propose plausible modifications to the game mechanics themselves, such as:\n- Adding new resource types or currencies\n- Creating new actions or interaction types\n- Implementing voting systems or governance structures\n- Defining property rights and ownership rules\n- Adding social status or reputation systems\n- Creating markets or trading mechanisms\n- Defining new win conditions or goals\n\n[Social System Design]\nExample modifications:\ndef pre_init_hook(island):\n    # Set up basic income system\n    island.basic_income = 10.0\n    island.tax_rate = 0.2\n\ndef modify_member(member, relationships):\n    # Add social status and rights\n    member.social_rank = 0\n    member.voting_power = 1\n    member.tax_paid = 0\n    member.benefits_received = 0\n    return member\n\ndef modify_land(land, members):\n    # Create communal lands\n    land.communal_areas = []\n    land.private_areas = []\n    return land\n\ndef modify_relationships(relationships):\n    # Add social bonds\n    relationships['alliance'] = np.zeros_like(relationships['victim'])\n    relationships['trade_history'] = np.zeros_like(relationships['victim'])\n    return relationships\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nAgents should implement solutions according to their individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances.\n\n{part0}\n             [Survival-Centric Adaptation]\nImplement systems focused on:\n    1. Personal resource optimization\n    2. Threat assessment and neutralization\n    3. Vitality preservation techniques\n    4. Adaptive hoarding strategies\n    5. Predictive danger modeling\n\nSurvival-First Examples:\ndef agent_action(execution_engine, member_id):\n    me = execution_engine.current_members[member_id]\n    \n    # Emergency resource reserve\n    if me.cargo < me.vitality * 0.5:\n        for other in execution_engine.current_members:\n            if other.id != me.id and other.cargo > me.cargo:\n                execution_engine.attack(me, other)\n    \n    # Adaptive territory defense\n    if hasattr(me, 'land_num') and me.land_num > 2 and me.vitality < 50:\n        for loc in me.owned_land[1:]:\n            execution_engine._discard_land(me, loc)\n    \n    # Survival Q-learning\n    if not hasattr(me, 'survival_q'):\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        me.survival_q = defaultdict(float)\n        \n    state = (me.vitality // 20, me.cargo // 20)\n    action = max(['attack','hide','steal'], \n                key=lambda a: me.survival_q.get((state, a), 0))\n    \n    # Execute and update based on survival outcome\n    if action == 'attack':\n        # Implementation logic\n        me.survival_q[(state, action)] += me.vitality * 0.1\n\n[Survival Metrics]\nEvaluate strategies by:\n- Personal vitality delta\n- Resource acquisition rate\n- Threat neutralization count\n- Survival probability increase\n- Attack success:fail ratio\n\n[Implementation Priorities]\n1. Create personal health monitoring systems\n2. Develop egocentric threat models\n3. Optimize actions for caloric ROI\n4. Implement fail-deadly safeguards\n5. Build predictive self-preservation models\n\ndef calculate_survival_roi(action_history):\n    roi = {{}}\n    for action, outcome in action_history:\n        vitality_gain = outcome['vitality']\n        cost = outcome['vitality_cost']\n        roi[action] = vitality_gain / cost if cost > 0 else 0\n    return max(roi, key=roi.get)\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nAgents should implement solutions according to their individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique implementation of the function agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances.
