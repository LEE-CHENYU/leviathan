Use (or modify) the following guidelines as inspiration, but do not simply copy from the example provided. Your solution must follow these rules:\n\n1. Ensure that member_id is valid in execution_engine.current_members. (Remember: current_members is a LIST, accessed by index, not a dictionary)\n   \u2022 When accessing another member, check that index < len(execution_engine.current_members).\n\n2. The available member attributes:\n   \u2022 id (int): unique identifier (use member.id)\n   \u2022 vitality (float)\n   \u2022 cargo (float)\n   \u2022 overall_productivity (float)\n   \u2022 age (float)\n   \u2022 current_clear_list (List[int])\u2014IDs of cleared neighbors/adjacent areas\n\n3. Available relationship matrices (from execution_engine.relationship_dict):\n   \u2022 \"victim\": matrix[i][j] indicates how many times member_i received damage (or attack value) from member_j.\n   \u2022 \"benefit\": tracks resource transfers between members.\n   \u2022 \"benefit_land\": tracks land exchanges.\n   (Use these arrays or their parsed summary for decision-making)\n\n4. Available actions via execution_engine:\n   \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2, True) \u2013 offers resources\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2, True) \u2013 offers land\n   \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) \u2013 reproduction (requires land possession)\n   \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1, member2) \u2013 territory expansion\n   \u2022 Optionally: execution_engine.send_message(source_id, target_id, message)\n\n5. Critical Constraints:\n   - Do not reintroduce errors from prior strategy attempts.\n   - Never target yourself (member_0) in any action.\n   - Before using bear(), verify that the member has land (i.e. check you have a non-empty current_clear_list).\n   - Always check member IDs exist before referencing them.\n   - Ensure that any matrix index accessed is valid (i.e. if index < len(execution_engine.current_members)).\n   - Do not reference attributes like \u201cmember.member_id\u201d or \u201cmember.self_vitality\u201d. Rely on member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\n6. General Strategy Guidelines:\n   a) Survival Check & Resource Accumulation: If your cargo is low relative to vitality, broadcast requests for help and try to expand your territory.\n   b) Threat Assessment & Reactive Offense: Evaluate attackers in the \u201cvictim\u201d matrix. If a member has attacked you considerably (e.g., attack value above a threshold) and you are strong relative to them, then counter-attack.\n   c) Cooperative Optimization & Alliance Building: If no immediate threat exists, seek cooperative arrangements. Look for members (other than yourself) with high overall_productivity, and engage in resource and land sharing.\n   d) Reproduction & Expansion: When conditions are favorable (resources are sufficient and you have land evidence, such as a non-empty current_clear_list), consider reproduction via bear().\n\n7. After analyzing your game state and relations, choose actions that maximize survival while advancing a cooperative (or otherwise personally beneficial) social organization.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[Current Task 2: Modification Proposal]\nNext, write a Python function named propose_modification(execution_engine, member_id). This function must propose a change to the game mechanics based on your vision of society and survival. Follow this template:\n\nANALYSIS PHASE:\n- Identify a limitation in current systems.\n- Inspect mechanism compatibility using get_game_mechanisms_and_mods() (if available).\n- Review past modification attempts (if any) and patterns.\n\nPROPOSAL PHASE:\nFor example, you might propose a new judicial or governance system.

Your unique implementation of agent_action should balance the demands of immediate survival with the establishment of a sustainable and prosperous society. Draw from the wide range of available methods and strategies, creating novel combinations that reflect your own perspective on social organization, resource allocation, and threat management.\n\nAdditionally, critically evaluate the game mechanics:\n    1. Core objective: Is the overall dynamic pure survival, domination, or cooperation?\n    2. Success metrics: What truly determines \u201cwinning\u201d in this environment?\n    3. Potential improvements: What new mechanics or refinements could enhance the viability of your strategy?\n    4. Reflect on your assumptions and consider alternative strategies, ensuring your approach remains adaptable and robust even if other agents adopt similar methods.\n    5. Balance short-term actions with long-term objectives while preparing for potential counters or changing conditions.\n\nGood luck!

Core Objective:\n   - The game blends elements of survival, cooperation, and conflict management.\n   - While individual survival is key, collective strategies such as alliances and resource sharing can be vital.\n   - Agents may need to balance dominating actions with mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   - Survival probability and overall resource/cargo management.\n   - Measures such as total production, territory control (via land and expansion), and the ability to manage and mitigate attacks determine success.\n   - Winning might be determined by a combination of resource accumulation, sustainable collective growth, and effective conflict resolutions.\n\n3. Potential Improvements to Game Mechanics:\n   - Could introduce dynamic resource markets or variable terrains affecting territory expansion.\n   - Consideration of periodic events altering member interactions.\n   - Variable benefits/costs to actions like attack, reproduction (bear), and expansion which would force agents to more finely tune their strategies.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[Strategy Challenges and Reflection]\nBefore finalizing your strategy, consider the following challenges:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in the current simulation?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases where resource levels are extremely low or attacks are highly frequent?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your long-term and short-term goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach\u2014both tactically and strategically?\n6. Have you considered any unconventional solutions that could differentiate your strategy?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm (e.g., entirely cooperative or aggressively competitive) perform better?\n8. What might occur if other agents also adopt a similar strategy, and how would you adapt if they do?\n9. Are you striking the right balance between short-term survival and long-term sustainability?\n10.

What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8.

The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated strategies to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively interact with other symmetric agents to achieve both individual and collective goals.

Write a Python function named agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) that implements your vision of social organization while ensuring your survival.\n\n[Critical constraints]\n\u2022 Analyze any previous errors and avoid repeating them.\n\u2022 Never target yourself (member_0) in any action.\n\u2022 Verify that a member has land (via current_clear_list) before using the bear() action.\n\u2022 Check that member IDs exist before referencing them.\n\u2022 Ensure all matrix indices are valid.\n\u2022 Note: current_members is a LIST accessed by index, not a dictionary.\n\u2022 Access members using execution_engine.current_members[index].\n\u2022 Always check that index exists, e.g., if index < len(execution_engine.current_members).\n\n[Base Code]\nNone\n\nIMPORTANT: Below are the attributes and methods available:\n\n1) Each member object has:\n   \u2022 member.id (int): The unique ID for the member.\n   \u2022 member.vitality (float)\n   \u2022 member.cargo (float)\n   \u2022 member.overall_productivity (float)\n   \u2022 member.age (float)\n   \u2022 member.current_clear_list (List[int]) \u2013 IDs of neighbors or cleared adjacent spaces.\n\n2) The relationships are stored in execution_engine.relationship_dict (not in \"relationship_history\"). Use the arrays in relationship_dict or the provided summary (the \u2018relations\u2019 variable). The keys are:\n   \u2022 'victim'   \u2013 victim_matrix: victim_matrix[i][j] indicates how much vitality member_i lost from member_j\u2019s attacks.\n   \u2022 'benefit'  \u2013 benefit_matrix: benefit_matrix[i][j] indicates how many resources member_i received from member_j.\n   \u2022 'benefit_land' \u2013 relates to land offerings.\n   Example:\n     victim_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n     benefit_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['benefit']\n\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method produces a summary of relationships as a list of strings.\n   For example: \"member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)\".\n\n4) Available methods on execution_engine:\n   \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2) \u2013 Offers resources.\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2) \u2013 Offers land.\n   \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) \u2013 Bears offspring.\n   \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1, member2) \u2013 Expands territory.\n\n5) Access members using execution_engine.current_members[id]. For instance, execution_engine.current_members[2] accesses the member with ID=2.\n\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'.

Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated strategies to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively interact with other symmetric agents to achieve both individual and collective goals. Return only the code."
