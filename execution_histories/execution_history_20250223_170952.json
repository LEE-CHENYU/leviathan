Initialization & Resource Setup:\n       - Acquire self reference and ensure an 'oil' attribute exists. Oil represents an additional resource\n         which is necessary for territory expansion and market interactions.\n    2. Threat Management & Offensive Actions:\n       - Identify the aggressive member (member_2) based on cargo and past observations.\n       - Attack member_2 to curb their resource accumulation.\n    3. Diplomatic & Cooperative Moves:\n       - Identify a potential ally (member_3) with whom we have a beneficial relationship.\n       - Use a resource offer (via execution_engine.offer) to build trust with member_3,\n         thereby reducing the pressure from multiple fronts.\n    4. Territorial & Oil Extraction Actions:\n       - If oil reserves are low, expand territory to unlock further oil extraction.\n       - When sufficient oil is available, simulate a marketplace action by \u201cselling\u201d oil,\n         converting a portion of it into cargo to bolster our resources.\n    5. Reproduction for Long-Term Growth:\n       - If our member has established territory (indicated by a non-empty current_clear_list)\n         and high vitality, we use reproduction (bear) action with a willing partner who also has territory.\n         This helps increase our societal strength in the long term.\n    6. Safety & Execution Constraints:\n       - Never target ourselves.\n       - Always check member indices and verify conditions (like territory availability) before actions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure the current member exists and retrieve self.\n    if member_id >= len(execution_engine.current_members):\n        return  # invalid member ID; do nothing\n    self_member = execution_engine.current_members[member_id]\n\n    # Initialize 'oil' attribute if it doesn't exist.\n    if not hasattr(self_member, 'oil'):\n        self_member.oil = 0.0\n\n    # Identify key agents by iterating over current members.\n    threat_target = None    # Expected to be member_2 (aggressive, high cargo)\n    alliance_target = None  # Expected to be member_3 (potential cooperative partner)\n    for i in range(len(execution_engine.current_members)):\n        if i == member_id:\n            continue  # Skip self\n        other_member = execution_engine.current_members[i]\n        if hasattr(other_member, 'id'):\n            # Identify member_2 as threat, member_3 as alliance candidate.\n            if other_member.id == 2:\n                threat_target = other_member\n            elif other_member.id == 3:\n                alliance_target = other_member\n\n    # Offensive Action: Attack the threat (member_2) if valid.\n    if threat_target is not None:\n        # Check that threat_target indeed exists in the current members list.\n        if threat_target.id < len(execution_engine.current_members):\n            execution_engine.attack(self_member, threat_target)\n\n    # Diplomatic Action: Offer resources to build a tentative alliance with member_3.\n    if alliance_target is not None:\n        if alliance_target.id < len(execution_engine.current_members):\n            # Offer resources if our cargo exceeds the potential partner's cargo.\n            if self_member.cargo > alliance_target.cargo:\n                execution_engine.offer(self_member, alliance_target)\n\n    # Territorial Expansion & Oil Extraction:\n    # If oil is low, we expand our territory to access more oil.\n    if self_member.oil < 50:\n        execution_engine.expand(self_member)\n        # Simulate the extraction benefit by adding a fixed amount of oil.\n        self_member.oil += 10\n\n    # Marketplace Action: Convert oil to cargo when surplus oil is available.\n    # Here we simulate a market sale: using half our current oil reserve, selling it to gain cargo.\n    if self_member.oil > 30:\n        sale_oil = self_member.oil * 0.5  # Sell half of the available oil\n        conversion_rate = 0.8  # Assume that each unit of oil sold converts to cargo at this rate.\n        self_member.cargo += sale_oil * conversion_rate\n        self_member.oil -= sale_oil\n\n    # Reproduction (Bear) Action for Future Growth:\n    # Check that our member has clear territory (using current_clear_list as an indicator).\n    if len(self_member.current_clear_list) > 0 and self_member.vitality > 60:\n        # Choose the first valid partner (not self) who also appears to have territory.\n        partner = None\n        for j in range(len(execution_engine.current_members)):\n            if j == member_id:\n                continue  # avoid self-targeting\n            candidate = execution_engine.current_members[j]\n            if len(candidate.current_clear_list) > 0:\n                partner = candidate\n                break\n        if partner is not None:\n            execution_engine.bear(self_member, partner)  # Attempt reproduction\n\n    # End of agent_action; all actions are based on current state and strategic evaluation.",

Use the arrays in relationship_dict, or rely on the summary below (the 'relations' variable). The keys are: 'victim', 'benefit', 'benefit_land'. Example usage:\n        matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n        # matrix[i, j] indicates how many times member_i was attacked by member_j (if > 0).\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method is used to produce a summary of relationships as a list of strings. For example, 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)'.\n4) You can use these methods on execution_engine:\n    \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2, True) \u2013 Offers resources.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2, True) \u2013 Offers land.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) \u2013 Bears offspring.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1, member2) \u2013 Expands territory.\n5) The members are accessed by execution_engine.current_members[id]. For example, execution_engine.current_members[2] for the member with ID=2.\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'. Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\nAnalysis of the game state:\n['I am member_0.

In benefit exchanges, my benefit to member_3 (value = +723.24) and the benefit I received from member_3 (value = +683.23) imply a potentially strong, though complex, interaction with member_3.\n4. Member_2, despite offering me some benefit (+207.37), has also been very aggressive and has the highest cargo (74.30), which may allow that member to grow even stronger if left unchecked.\n\nBased on these facts, my strategies should be practical and focused on consolidating my strengths (high productivity and vitality) while curbing the competitive threats:\nA. Consolidate defenses and prepare for further aggressive actions from member_2 and member_3. My high vitality gives me an advantage in absorbing attacks, but their repeated aggression suggests a need for a well-planned defense.\nB. Target member_2 as a priority since their high cargo and overall aggressive behavior (attack value +573.88 against me) mean they are likely investing in becoming a resource powerhouse. I should allocate my resources (leveraging my high productivity) to execute more effective attacks on member_2. A successful offensive there might reduce their ability to accumulate resources.\nC. Manage the interaction with member_3 carefully. The high benefit exchanges indicate that while there is conflict (attack value +457.54 from member_3 against me), there is also mutual benefit. It might be effective to build a temporary strategic understanding or a detente with member_3, using our beneficial exchanges to ensure that we are not simultaneously attacked while I focus on the target with the greatest competitive threat (member_2).\nD. Monitor member_1 closely, although the data suggests a lower level of threat. Their lower vitality (44.33) and cargo (33.79) indicate that they are less capable of immediate aggression. At this time, it is more efficient to focus defensive and offensive efforts on member_2 and on managing the complex relationship with member_3.\nE. Continue to leverage my superior productivity to generate additional resources or opportunities that can be reinvested into strengthening cargo or defense. Increasing cargo may help me counter any resource advantage held by others, especially member_2.\n\nThese strategies are based solely on the concrete data available:\n\u2013 My high productivity and vitality provide a base for aggressive action.\n\u2013 The highest rival cargo is with member_2, who also attacks me vigorously.\n\u2013 The mixed, yet notably high, benefit numbers with member_3 suggest that an outright adversarial stance might not be necessary there, provided I can contain the threat from member_2.\n\nIn conclusion, the plan is to prioritize weakening member_2 using targeted offensive actions while using my strong defensive and productive capabilities. I will remain cautious with member_3, seeking to neutralize hostility with mutually beneficial interactions, and allow member_1 to play a lesser role in the immediate power dynamics. These strategies are data-driven and focused on maintaining my competitive advantage and survival.']\n\nCurrent status:\nHere are the basic information of all members, you should make your own decisions based on them:\n   self_productivity  self_vitality  self_cargo  self_age  self_neighbor  member_id\n0       9.851974      73.853828   43.512771        90              0          0\n1       9.083010      44.332577   33.786614        61              0          1\n2       8.874254      63.349332   74.301507        24              0          2\n3       7.968737      42.156043   40.255083        29              0          3\n\nRelationship summary (parsed from relationship_dict):\nHere are the relationships between members:\n['member_0 was attacked by member_1 (value=-167.79)', 'member_0 was attacked by member_2 (value=573.88)', 'member_0 was attacked by member_3 (value=457.54)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_0 (value=-379.31)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_2 (value=-78.15)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_3 (value=257.26)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_0 (value=-465.91)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=-197.53)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_3 (value=135.47)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_0 (value=706.74)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_1 (value=96.72)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_2 (value=832.60)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=-463.73)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=590.27)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=723.24)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=-277.58)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=162.09)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=-231.52)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=207.37)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=-369.99)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=481.30)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=683.23)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=524.30)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=824.80)', 'member_0 gave land to member_1 (value=25.73)', 'member_0 gave land to member_2 (value=-20.62)', 'member_0 gave land to member_3 (value=17.15)', 'member_1 gave land to member_0 (value=3.84)', 'member_1 gave land to member_2 (value=-20.63)', 'member_1 gave land to member_3 (value=-19.61)', 'member_2 gave land to member_0 (value=12.92)', 'member_2 gave land to member_1 (value=-27.78)', 'member_2 gave land to member_3 (value=5.58)', 'member_3 gave land to member_0 (value=-22.84)', 'member_3 gave land to member_1 (value=4.60)', 'member_3 gave land to member_2 (value=-10.39)']\n\nCode Memory and Previous Performance:\nNo previous code history.\n\nAnalysis Memory:\nPrevious analysis reports: ['I am member_0.

Instead, use it as inspiration to create your own unique approach combining different methods and strategies in novel ways.\nWhile the example above shows one possible approach, you should create your own unique implementation drawing from the wide range of available methods and strategies.\nConsider novel combinations of different approaches rather than following this exact pattern.\n\n[Core Game Mechanics & Parameters]\nThe island simulation has several key systems that agents should understand:\n\n1. Relationship System (_MIN_MAX_INIT_RELATION):\n   - victim: [-50, 100] \u2013 Tracks damage received from others.\n   - benefit: [-50, 100] \u2013 Records resources received from others.\n   - benefit_land: [-3, 3] \u2013 Tracks land exchanges.\n2. Population Mechanics:\n   - _REPRODUCE_REQUIREMENT = 100 (Combined vitality/cargo needed)\n   - Land must exceed population (land_shape[0] * land_shape[1] > population)\n   - _NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_RANGE = 1000 for interaction radius.\n3. Record Keeping (every _RECORD_PERIOD = 1):\n   - Tracks all attacks, benefits, land transfers.\n   - Monitors births, deaths, land ownership.\n   - Records production, consumption, and performance metrics.\n\n[Example Mechanism Extensions]\n# Basic mechanism template:\nif not hasattr(island, 'new_system'):\n    class CustomMechanism:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.data = {}\n            self.meta = {'version': 1.0, 'type': 'custom'}\n    \n    island.new_system = CustomMechanism()\n\n# Member capability example:\ndef modify_member(member, relationships):\n    if not hasattr(member, 'custom_abilities'):\n        member.custom_abilities = {}\n    \n    # Add trading capability\n    member.custom_abilities['trade'] = lambda resource: (\n        print(f\"Trading {resource}\") if member.vitality > 20 else None\n    )\n    return member\n\n# Land modification example:\ndef modify_land(land, members):\n    if not hasattr(land, 'zoning'):\n        land.zoning = {\n            'residential': 0.4,\n            'agricultural': 0.4,\n            'commercial': 0.2\n        }\n    \n    # Add development tracking\n    land.development_level = np.zeros(land.shape)\n    return land\n\n# Relationship system extension:\ndef modify_relationships(relationships):\n    relationships.trust_matrix = np.zeros_like(relationships['benefit'])\n    return relationships\n\n[Implementation Patterns]\n1. Check existence first: if not hasattr(obj, 'feature')\n2. Add attributes directly: obj.new_feature = ...\n3. Use simple data structures: dicts, lists, numpy arrays.\n4. Include version metadata in new systems.\n5. Add cleanup methods for complex systems.\n\n[Error Prevention]\n- Use try-except when accessing new features.\n- Check attribute existence before use.\n- Maintain backward compatibility.\n- Use version checks for existing systems:\n  if (hasattr(island, 'market') and \n      getattr(island.market, 'version', 0) < 2):\n      # Add compatibility layer\n      island.market.legacy_support = True\n\n[Active Game Mechanisms]\nThe following mechanisms have been added by agents and can be referenced when making your own modifications. Review them carefully to:\n1. Understand existing functionality and avoid conflicts.\n2. Build upon successful patterns and improvements.\n3. Identify opportunities for optimization or extension.\n4. Remove or deprecate mechanisms that are detrimental to your survival.\n\nWhen proposing changes, ensure they:\n- Align with your agent's goals and survival strategy.\n- Maintain compatibility with other active mechanisms.\n- Include proper versioning and rollback procedures.\n- Follow best practices for stability and performance.\n\n[Modification Attempt History]\n[Previous Modification History]\nReview your past modification attempts below to inform future proposals:\n- Learn from successful patterns and approaches.\n- Avoid repeating failed strategies.\n- Build upon and extend working mechanisms.\n- Identify opportunities for optimization.\n\n[Message Context]\nHere are the messages sent by other agents, you can use them as reference to make your own decisions:\nNo messages received\n\n[Modification Proposal Guide]\nTo propose rule changes, follow this template:\n\n1.

Namespace Conflicts: Check existing mechanisms with dir(execution_engine).\n2. Invalid References: Use execution_engine.current_members not global members.\n3. Version Mismatches: Increment version when modifying existing systems.\n4. Resource Leaks: Include cleanup functions for new mechanisms.\n\n[Best Practices]\n- Propose small, testable changes first.\n- Include rollback procedures in code.\n- Add version checks to modifications.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nAdditional Context and Analysis:\n\nBased on previous performance and the current simulation state, your modification proposal should take into account the following:\n\u2022 Core Objective: The game appears to be a balance between survival, consolidation of strengths, and targeted offensive/defensive maneuvers. You must decide whether your approach should prioritize pure survival, domination through aggressive actions, or cooperation with selective agents.\n\u2022 Key Success Metrics: The true measures of \u201cwinning\u201d may be overall resource accumulation (cargo), strong vitality (for defense), strategic land use (for oil extraction and expansion), and optimizing relationships to minimize threats. Consider which of these metrics you can affect best through policy changes.\n\u2022 Potential Improvements: Consider adding mechanisms that allow for dynamic market behavior (such as buying and selling oil), territory expansion tied to resource extraction, and more granular control over relationship matrices. Perhaps extend the current relationship system by including a \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201cdiplomacy\u201d score to mediate conflicts and create alliances that could ensure long-term survival.\n\u2022 Implementation Considerations: Make sure your modifications include proper versioning, attribute checks, cleanup functions, and fail-safes to maintain backward compatibility with existing systems. Consider edge cases such as certain agents lacking the necessary land or members whose indices may be invalid.\n\nChallenge your implementation:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term and long-term objectives optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nTHE FINAL TASK:\nImplement a Python function named propose_modification(execution_engine) with your unique approach. Your implementation should utilize available methods (attack, offer, offer_land, bear, expand) while obeying all critical constraints and using the provided member attributes and relationship structures. Ensure your code checks for attribute existence, validates indices in execution_engine.current_members, and does not target your own member (member_0). Consider integrating new capabilities\u2014for example, adding oil as a property, managing a marketplace for cargo exchanges with oil, and expanding territory using acquired oil\u2014while creating rollback and versioning procedures for your modifications.\n\nReturn the updated prompt as the foundation for your modifications. Remember that while the provided examples serve as guidance, the implementation must be your own unique synthesis of strategies aimed at survival and shaping the social organization on the island.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThis is the updated full prompt. Agents should now refer to it when constructing their propose_modification function. Your modifications should reflect a deep understanding of both the game mechanics and the strategic implications of each change, balancing immediate survival tactics with long-term competitive advantages.\n\nRemember: Design your modifications in a flexible, versioned manner that can easily roll back or evolve as the game state and interactions among agents unfold.\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nUse this integrated prompt as your blueprint for implementing solutions that are as innovative as they are robust, ensuring alignment with your goals and the overall dynamics of the island simulation.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

The strategy balances short\u2010term resource gains\n    and long\u2010term alliance building:\n\n    1. Oil Extraction: Introduces an \"oil_system\" to track oil market info and equips each member with an 'oil'\n       attribute if they don't already have one. Our agent (assumed to be member with id=2) extracts oil to boost\n       its resource pool.\n\n    2. Territory Expansion: Uses available clearance info (current_clear_list) to expand territory, which is a\n       prerequisite for oil extraction and reproduction. The agent expands territory using an adjacent member.\n\n    3. Marketplace and Alliances: A simple marketplace is established within the oil_system that records oil prices.\n       Furthermore, the modification reinforces our alliance with member_3 by offering land as a sign of cooperation,\n       while ensuring we never target ourselves (member_2). It also offers resources to other members to encourage trade.\n\n    Error prevention and integrity checks are integrated:\n       \u2022 Verify member indices before accessing.\n       \u2022 Use hasattr checks for new attributes.\n       \u2022 Avoid self-targeting.\n       \u2022 Confirm existence of relationships and neighbor indices.\n\n    Overall, the modifications extend existing game mechanics, reinforcing long\u2010term survival via resource extraction,\n    trade, and strategic territorial gains.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # ----- Step 1: Initialize Oil System if not present -----\n    if not hasattr(execution_engine, 'oil_system'):\n        class OilSystem:\n            def __init__(self):\n                self.version = 1.0\n                # A marketplace registry mapping member_id to their oil sale price (per unit oil)\n                self.prices = {}\n                # A log of marketplace transactions (for potential rollback or analysis)\n                self.market_log = []\n        execution_engine.oil_system = OilSystem()\n\n    # ----- Step 2: Equip Each Member with an 'oil' Attribute -----\n    for member in execution_engine.current_members:\n        if not hasattr(member, 'oil'):\n            member.oil = 0.0  # Initialize oil storage to 0 units\n\n    # Identify ourself: our agent is member_2.

What is the core objective? Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?\n2. What are the key success metrics (e.g., vitality, cargo, land control) that truly determine \u201cwinning\u201d?\n3. Which mechanics can be added or modified to improve your position (e.g., oil extraction, market creation, territorial expansion)?\n4. What assumptions am I making, and are they valid?\n5. What alternative strategies have I not considered?\n6. How will my strategy perform in edge cases?\n7. Are there more efficient ways to achieve the same goals?\n8. What weaknesses exist in my current approach?\n9. Have I considered unconventional or entirely different paradigms?\n10. What might happen if other agents adopt a similar strategy, and how would I adapt to that?\n11. Am I balancing short-term pressures and long-term objectives optimally?\n12. How could my strategy be countered, and what is my plan to respond?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[Final Directive]\nImplement the function propose_modification(execution_engine) with your unique approach.

Establish an OilMarket system on the island if not already present. This system\n       enables members to list extracted oil for sale and buy oil to potentially expand their territory.\n    2. For each member, add \"oil\" and \"land\" properties if not already defined. We assume that having\n       any cleared territory (verified via current_clear_list) counts as owning land.\n    3. For our member (member_3), if we have land, extract oil at a rate proportional to our territory.\n       Once we accumulate sufficient oil, we list all our oil for sale at an arbitrarily chosen price.\n    4. Engage in territorial expansion by using our relative resources. We attempt to use the expand()\n       action on members that currently possess land if our combined vitality and cargo metrics are better.\n    5. Extend diplomatic cooperation by sending benefits (using offer()) to older members,\n       who may share mutual interests based on historical interactions.\n    6. As long-term planning, if our combined resources (vitality + cargo) exceed a threshold and land is available,\n       we trigger reproduction (via bear()) with a partner.\n\n    All actions are guarded by validations:\n      \u2022 We check that indices exist when accessing execution_engine.current_members.\n      \u2022 We never target self (member_3) when interacting with others.\n      \u2022 We verify that a member has land before calling bear().\n      \u2022 We use try/except blocks to catch errors from expand(), offer(), and bear() actions.\n\n    The modifications strike a balance between short\u2010term defensive tactics and long\u2010term thriving through economic\n    development (oil extraction/trading), territorial expansion, and alliance-building.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.

Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\n[Analysis of the game state:]\n['I am member_3. My current metrics are as follows: my productivity is 7.97, vitality is 42.16, and cargo is 40.26. My age is 29, meaning I\u2019m not among the oldest (member_0 is 90, member_1 is 61) and not the youngest (member_2 is 24). Compared to the others, my vitality is the lowest (just below member_1\u2019s 44.33), and my productivity is also the smallest; however, my cargo is reasonable though still behind member_2\u2019s 74.30.\n\nThe relationship log provides clear, concrete interactions:\n\u2022 I have attacked all the other members: I attacked member_0 (457.54), member_1 (257.26), and member_2 (135.47).  \n\u2022 In return, both member_0 and member_2 have launched high-magnitude attacks against me (member_0: 706.74 and member_2: 832.60). Member_1\u2019s attack on me is smaller (96.72).  \n\u2022 There is also a mixed record of benefit exchanges\u2014several benefits have been given between parties. For example, member_0 gave a benefit to me valued at 723.24, while I gave a benefit to member_0 valued at 683.23, indicating a high level of reciprocal activity even amid aggression.\n\nBased on these concrete facts, I propose the following practical and data-driven strategies:\n\n1. Strengthen Defensive Capacity:\n   \u2022 My current vitality (42.16) is lower than that of members 0 and 2. Given the high-intensity attacks from both (706.74 and 832.60), my immediate priority must be to bolster my vitality.  \n   \u2022 I should carefully convert available cargo into vitality or defensive improvements (if the mechanisms allow resource conversion), thereby mitigating damage from future attacks.\n\n2. Reassess Aggressive Engagements:\n   \u2022 The data shows that my attack efforts have not deterred aggressive responses; both member_0 and member_2 have counterattacked strongly.  \n   \u2022 Until I can improve my defensive metrics, I should limit further offensive actions that might weaken my position and provoke heavier retaliation.\n\n3. Pursue Diplomatic Maneuvers:\n   \u2022 Although I have been involved in mutual aggression, the benefit exchange records show that there is also a channel of cooperation. For instance, member_0 gave me a significant benefit (723.24), and member_2 also gave me a benefit (481.30).  \n   \u2022 I should propose a temporary ceasefire or mutual nonaggression pact with member_0 and member_2. Emphasizing the measurable mutual benefits (documented by prior benefit transfers) could help lower the current aggressiveness.\n   \u2022 Engaging in verified and data-based negotiations could help shift some of my cargo resources into cooperative channels rather than being expended in hostilities.\n\n4. Optimize Resource Allocation:\n   \u2022 Given that my cargo-to-vitality ratio is near 1:1 (40.26 cargo to 42.16 vitality), I have limited margin for error.  \n   \u2022 I must ensure I retain adequate cargo not only for defense and vitality improvement but also for leveraging in future negotiations. A reserve strategy is essential.\n\n5. Monitor Age and Productivity:\n   \u2022 Although my productivity is lower than that of member_0 and member_1, my age (29) gives me the potential for a longer period of improvement relative to the older members.\n   \u2022 I should aim to gradually improve my production efficiency if possible, so over time I can catch up in resource generation\u2014a fact that is essential to long-term survival.\n\nIn summary, given the concrete facts\u2014the relatively low vitality, the high-magnitude counterattacks from key members, and the mixed but traceable benefit exchanges\u2014the most effective strategy is to focus first on strengthening my defensive resources and vitality while opening a measured diplomatic channel with those who have both attacked and cooperated with me. This balanced approach (bolstering internal capacity, preserving cargo reserves, and reducing external aggression) offers the most practical and data-driven path to survival and improved competitiveness.]\n\n[Current status:]\nBasic information of all members (columns: self_productivity, self_vitality, self_cargo, self_age, self_neighbor, member_id):\n0   9.851974   73.853828  43.512771   90   0   0\n1   9.083010   44.332577  33.786614   61   0   1\n2   8.874254   63.349332  74.301507   24   0   2\n3   7.968737   42.156043  40.255083   29   0   3\n\nRelationship summary (parsed from relationship_dict):\nRelationships between members:\n['member_0 was attacked by member_1 (value=-167.79)', 'member_0 was attacked by member_2 (value=573.88)', 'member_0 was attacked by member_3 (value=457.54)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_0 (value=-379.31)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_2 (value=-78.15)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_3 (value=257.26)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_0 (value=-465.91)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=-197.53)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_3 (value=135.47)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_0 (value=706.74)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_1 (value=96.72)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_2 (value=832.60)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=-463.73)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=590.27)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=723.24)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=-277.58)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=162.09)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=-231.52)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=207.37)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=-369.99)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=481.30)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=683.23)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=524.30)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=824.80)', 'member_0 gave land to member_1 (value=25.73)', 'member_0 gave land to member_2 (value=-20.62)', 'member_0 gave land to member_3 (value=17.15)', 'member_1 gave land to member_0 (value=3.84)', 'member_1 gave land to member_2 (value=-20.63)', 'member_1 gave land to member_3 (value=-19.61)', 'member_2 gave land to member_0 (value=12.92)', 'member_2 gave land to member_1 (value=-27.78)', 'member_2 gave land to member_3 (value=5.58)', 'member_3 gave land to member_0 (value=-22.84)', 'member_3 gave land to member_1 (value=4.60)', 'member_3 gave land to member_2 (value=-10.39)']\n\n[Code Memory and Previous Performance:]\nNo previous code history.\n\n[Analysis Memory:]\nPrevious analysis reports:\n['I am member_3.

Relationship System (_MIN_MAX_INIT_RELATION):\n   - victim: [-50, 100] - Tracks damage received from others.\n   - benefit: [-50, 100] - Records resources received from others.\n   - benefit_land: [-3, 3] - Tracks land exchanges.\n\n2. Population Mechanics:\n   - _REPRODUCE_REQUIREMENT = 100 (Combined vitality/cargo needed).\n   - Land must exceed population (land_shape[0] * land_shape[1] > population).\n   - _NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_RANGE = 1000 for interaction radius.\n\n3. Record Keeping (every _RECORD_PERIOD = 1):\n   - Tracks all attacks, benefits, land transfers.\n   - Monitors births, deaths, land ownership.\n   - Records production, consumption, and performance metrics.\n\n[Example Mechanism Extensions]\n# Basic mechanism template:\nif not hasattr(island, 'new_system'):\n    class CustomMechanism:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.data = {}\n            self.meta = {'version': 1.0, 'type': 'custom'}\n    \n    island.new_system = CustomMechanism()\n\n# Member capability example:\ndef modify_member(member, relationships):\n    if not hasattr(member, 'custom_abilities'):\n        member.custom_abilities = {}\n    \n    # Add trading capability.\n    member.custom_abilities['trade'] = lambda resource: (\n         print(f\"Trading {resource}\") if member.vitality > 20 else None\n    )\n    return member\n\n# Land modification example:\ndef modify_land(land, members):\n    if not hasattr(land, 'zoning'):\n        land.zoning = {\n           'residential': 0.4,\n           'agricultural': 0.4,\n           'commercial': 0.2\n        }\n    \n    # Add development tracking.\n    land.development_level = np.zeros(land.shape)\n    return land\n\n# Relationship system extension:\ndef modify_relationships(relationships):\n    relationships.trust_matrix = np.zeros_like(relationships['benefit'])\n    return relationships\n\n[Implementation Patterns]\n1.

Core Objective:\n   The overall purpose of the island simulation involves balancing survival, resource management, and strategic interactions amongst agents. Success can be pure survival, temporary cooperation, or territorial expansion depending on the modifications made. Your chosen objective (be it survival through defense, cooperation through trade, or domination via expansion) should directly align with your modification strategy.\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   Success is measured by a member\u2019s vitality, cargo (especially oil as a new resource), territory control, and productivity compared to other members. Record keeping on attacks, benefits, land transfers, and birth/death dynamics, along with relationship metrics, determine winning positions.\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n   - Mechanisms for resource conversion (cargo to vitality or land upgrades).\n   - Enhanced trade systems for oil and cargo exchanges.\n   - More dynamic negotiation and attack/defense balancing.\n   - New modular systems ensuring compatibility with the current relationship and reproduction mechanics.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCHALLENGES TO YOUR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\n\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid given the game state and member capabilities?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered? Think of both aggressive and cooperative paradigms.\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases (extreme resource shortages, unexpected member reactions, etc.)?\n4. Are there more efficient or elegant ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach, and how might an opponent counter them?\n6. Have you considered unconventional or innovative solutions beyond the standard patterns?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm (e.g., a shift to alliance-based survival) work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy? Is your proposal robust under widespread adoption?\n9. Are you balancing short-term survival and long-term growth optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt in response?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFINAL REMINDER:\nAgents should implement solutions according to their individual strategic needs, personal beliefs, and the particular circumstances they face in the simulation. Your proposal must combine the available methods in unique and thoughtful ways, ensuring not only immediate survivability but also sustainable long-term operation on the island. \n\nRemember, the goal is to innovate within the provided constraints while avoiding common errors and ensuring full compatibility with the current game\u2019s systems.

Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\nAnalysis of the game state:\n['I am member_1. Reviewing the concrete metrics and recent interactions, here is my current situation and what I propose:\n\n1. Our own basic stats are: productivity \u22489.08, vitality \u224844.33, and cargo \u224833.79. Compared to member_0 (productivity 9.85, vitality 73.85, cargo 43.51), I have slightly lower vitality and cargo. By contrast, member_2 (productivity 8.87, vitality 63.35, cargo 74.30) holds a high cargo reserve and respectable vitality even though they are much younger (age 24), suggesting they can mobilize resources rapidly. Member_3 (productivity 7.97, vitality \u224842.16, cargo 40.26) is similar to us in vitality and slightly lower in productivity.\n\n2. Relationship history shows:\n \u2022 I attacked member_0 and member_3 (the record \u201cmember_3 was attacked by member_1 (value=96.72)\u201d indicates a minor action here). I also initiated benefits such as \u201cmember_1 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=162.09)\u201d but I imposed a penalty or provided reduced benefits toward member_0 and member_3 on other occasions.\n \u2022 Notably, member_3 has given me a strong benefit (\u201cmember_3 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=524.30)\u201d), which is a robust signal of favor.\n \u2022 On the other hand, I have received attacks from member_0 (value= -379.31) and member_2 (value= -78.15), while an attack from member_3 (value=257.26) suggests a mixed dynamic.\n \n3. Analysis of concrete factors:\n \u2022 My moderate vitality means I need to be cautious in direct confrontations, especially with members who have higher vitality or resource stockpiles (member_0 and member_2).\n \u2022 Member_2\u2019s high cargo and younger age may indicate a capacity to invest aggressively; keeping a close watch on them is advised.\n \u2022 Member_3\u2019s positive benefit suggests an opportunity to build a defensive or cooperative alliance\u2014a strong partner can help balance hostile ventures from others.\n \n4. Proposed strategies:\n   A. Strengthen the Alliance with member_3:\n      \u2013 Given the strong positive benefit (524.30) from member_3 and our similar vitality levels, coordinating actions (such as mutual defense or joint resource projects) may enhance our survivability.\n      \u2013 Initiate cooperative exchanges by offering beneficial interactions (for example, transferring small amounts of cargo or land when data confirm a net positive effect).\n \n   B. Monitor and Possibly Curb member_2\u2019s Growth:\n      \u2013 Their high cargo reserve (74.30) and moderate vitality (63.35) indicate they are a significant factor. While I've given benefits (162.09), their mixed history (including an attack with -78.15) signals potential future threats.\n      \u2013 If their resource accumulation accelerates, consider a cautious, minimal attack or renegotiation of benefits\u2014in a data-driven manner.\n \n   C. Avoid Escalation with member_0:\n      \u2013 With higher vitality (73.85) and older age (90), they appear less agile but still formidable. My past interactions indicate a complex relationship.\n      \u2013 For now, avoid further direct conflict with member_0 and direct actions toward dynamics with member_2 and member_3.\n \n   D. Resource and Territory Considerations:\n      \u2013 Although direct content on territory is limited aside from historical land transfers, ensure that any further land trades or cargo exchanges yield clear net gains.\n      \u2013 Monitor the land ownership map and production/consumption flows so that any future trade or transfers are based on quantitative improvements in vitality or cargo.\n\n5. Summary Decision:\n   \u2013 Prioritize a reliable partnership with member_3 through our positive benefit history for coordinated resource management and defense.\n   \u2013 Keep an eye on member_2\u2019s resource trends and be prepared to make interventions if their growth starts to threaten survival.\n   \u2013 Maintain a cautious stance toward member_0 until their actions indicate a clear threat or opportunity.\n   \u2013 Base further decisions on quantitative improvements in cargo, vitality, and alliance benefits.\n\nThese strategies are strictly based on the concrete facts and recent transactional data without extravagant assumptions\u2014only pragmatic interventions to maximize our survival.\n\nCurrent status:\nBasic information of all members:\n   self_productivity  self_vitality  self_cargo  self_age  self_neighbor  member_id\n0           9.851974      73.853828   43.512771        90              0          0\n1           9.083010      44.332577   33.786614        61              0          1\n2           8.874254      63.349332   74.301507        24              0          2\n3           7.968737      42.156043   40.255083        29              0          3\n\nRelationship summary:\n['member_0 was attacked by member_1 (value=-167.79)', 'member_0 was attacked by member_2 (value=573.88)', 'member_0 was attacked by member_3 (value=457.54)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_0 (value=-379.31)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_2 (value=-78.15)', 'member_1 was attacked by member_3 (value=257.26)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_0 (value=-465.91)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=-197.53)', 'member_2 was attacked by member_3 (value=135.47)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_0 (value=706.74)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_1 (value=96.72)', 'member_3 was attacked by member_2 (value=832.60)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=-463.73)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=590.27)', 'member_0 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=723.24)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=-277.58)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=162.09)', 'member_1 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=-231.52)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=207.37)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=-369.99)', 'member_2 gave a benefit to member_3 (value=481.30)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_0 (value=683.23)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_1 (value=524.30)', 'member_3 gave a benefit to member_2 (value=824.80)', 'member_0 gave land to member_1 (value=25.73)', 'member_0 gave land to member_2 (value=-20.62)', 'member_0 gave land to member_3 (value=17.15)', 'member_1 gave land to member_0 (value=3.84)', 'member_1 gave land to member_2 (value=-20.63)', 'member_1 gave land to member_3 (value=-19.61)', 'member_2 gave land to member_0 (value=12.92)', 'member_2 gave land to member_1 (value=-27.78)', 'member_2 gave land to member_3 (value=5.58)', 'member_3 gave land to member_0 (value=-22.84)', 'member_3 gave land to member_1 (value=4.60)', 'member_3 gave land to member_2 (value=-10.39)']\n\nCode Memory and Previous Performance:\nNo previous code history.\n\nAnalysis Memory:\nPrevious analysis reports have been summarized above.\n\nPerformance history:\nNo previous actions.\n\nBased on the previous code performance, adapt and improve the strategy.\nIf a previous strategy worked well (high performance), consider building upon it.\nIf it failed, try a different approach.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not simply copy the example implementation below.

My current core statistics are as follows:\n \u2022 Productivity: 8.87\n \u2022 Vitality: 63.35\n \u2022 Cargo: 74.30\n \u2022 Age: 24\n\nIn comparison:\n \u2022 Member_0 has slightly higher productivity (9.85) and vitality (73.85) but lower cargo (43.51) and is much older (90);\n \u2022 Member_1 shows moderate values (productivity 9.08, vitality 44.33, cargo 33.79, age 61);\n \u2022 Member_3 is slightly below me in productivity (7.97) and vitality (42.16) and cargo (40.25) but is older than me (29).\n\nThe documented interactions are quantifiable. For instance, member_2 was attacked by member_0 with a value of \u2013465.91 and by member_1 with \u2013197.53, whereas member_2 was attacked by member_3 with a positive value (135.47). On the benefit side, member_0 has given me a benefit of 590.27 and member_3 a larger benefit of 824.80, while I have extended benefits (207.37 to member_0, \u2013369.99 to member_1, and 481.30 to member_3). Land transfers remain relatively minor in magnitude, but member_0\u2019s land transfer to me is \u201320.62.\n\nBased on these concrete facts and numbers, I propose the following strategies:\n\n1. Build and consolidate alliances with members who have demonstrated strong beneficial interactions. Member_3, for example, has provided a high benefit (824.80) to me and also received a positive benefit from me (481.30). Strengthening relations with member_3 can serve both defensive and resource-related roles. Similarly, member_0 has provided a benefit of 590.27, so maintaining a cordial if cautious relationship there could lower further aggression.\n\n2. Recognize the disparity in vitality. My vitality of 63.35, while respectable, is notably lower than member_0\u2019s 73.85. Since vitality is often crucial for survival in conflict scenarios, I should consider strategies (within available game mechanisms) that allow me to reinforce my vitality, such as redirecting cargo or production surpluses toward vitality improvements if the game permits resource reallocation or trade for vitality.\n\n3. Leverage my strong cargo advantage. With the highest cargo (74.30), I have economic resources that may be used to establish deals or exchanges that enhance my position further. This cargo edge could be directed toward securing more resources or land if such mechanisms exist. Using this economic strength to negotiate mutually beneficial exchanges or to invest in upgrades could be vital if threats increase.\n\n4. Exercise caution against members with mixed signals. While member_0 has provided benefits, the significant negative attack value against me (\u2013465.91) warns of potential aggression. I should actively monitor any further hostile moves from member_0 and, if possible, counterbalance these with additional benefits or measures that reduce their incentives for attack.\n\n5. Identify targets if conflict becomes necessary. Given that member_1\u2019s vitality is relatively low (44.33) and cargo also lower (33.79), if I am forced into a conflict scenario, a measured approach against a weaker opponent like member_1 might be considered. However, any aggressive action should be weighed against the risks of escalating conflict and the potential loss of beneficial interactions.\n\nIn summary, the concrete data suggest that my survival hinges on maintaining and reinforcing alliances (particularly with member_3 and cautiously with member_0), investing excess cargo into improving vitality (or other critical defensive metrics), and being prepared to engage weaker opponents only as a last resort. These strategies are based on the numerical comparisons and documented interactions, and they aim to improve both my defensive resilience and economic strength moving forward.]\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCurrent status:\nHere are the basic information of all members.

My current core statistics are as follows:\n \u2022 Productivity: 8.87\n \u2022 Vitality: 63.35\n \u2022 Cargo: 74.30\n \u2022 Age: 24\n\nIn comparison:\n \u2022 Member_0 has slightly higher productivity (9.85) and vitality (73.85) but lower cargo (43.51) and is much older (90);\n \u2022 Member_1 shows moderate values (productivity 9.08, vitality 44.33, cargo 33.79, age 61);\n \u2022 Member_3 is slightly below me in productivity (7.97) and vitality (42.16) and cargo (40.25) but is older than me (29).\n\nThe documented interactions are quantifiable. For instance, member_2 was attacked by member_0 with a value of \u2013465.91 and by member_1 with \u2013197.53, whereas member_2 was attacked by member_3 with a positive value (135.47). On the benefit side, member_0 has given me a benefit of 590.27 and member_3 a larger benefit of 824.80, while I have extended benefits (207.37 to member_0, \u2013369.99 to member_1, and 481.30 to member_3). Land transfers remain relatively minor in magnitude, but member_0\u2019s land transfer to me is \u201320.62.\n\nBased on these concrete facts and numbers, I propose the following strategies:\n\n1. Build and consolidate alliances with members who have demonstrated strong beneficial interactions. Member_3, for example, has provided a high benefit (824.80) to me and also received a positive benefit from me (481.30). Strengthening relations with member_3 can serve both defensive and resource-related roles. Similarly, member_0 has provided a benefit of 590.27, so maintaining a cordial if cautious relationship there could lower further aggression.\n\n2. Recognize the disparity in vitality. My vitality of 63.35, while respectable, is notably lower than member_0\u2019s 73.85. Since vitality is often crucial for survival in conflict scenarios, I should consider strategies (within available game mechanisms) that allow me to reinforce my vitality, such as redirecting cargo or production surpluses toward vitality improvements if the game permits resource reallocation or trade for vitality.\n\n3. Leverage my strong cargo advantage. With the highest cargo (74.30), I have economic resources that may be used to establish deals or exchanges that enhance my position further. This cargo edge could be directed toward securing more resources or land if such mechanisms exist. Using this economic strength to negotiate mutually beneficial exchanges or to invest in upgrades could be vital if threats increase.\n\n4. Exercise caution against members with mixed signals. While member_0 has provided benefits, the significant negative attack value against me (\u2013465.91) warns of potential aggression. I should actively monitor any further hostile moves from member_0 and, if possible, counterbalance these with additional benefits or measures that reduce their incentives for attack.\n\n5.

The core objective \u2013 Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?\n   \u2022 Although survival remains critical, note that many mechanisms (alliance building, oil market, territorial expansion, and diplomacy) suggest that cooperative and mutually beneficial interactions are as important as any aggressive moves.\n\n2. Key success metrics \u2013 What truly determines \"winning\"?\n   \u2022 Winning might be defined by a combination of vitality, territory control, resource (cargo and oil) accumulation, stable alliances, and balanced relationships. Mobility, long-term resource management, and dynamic diplomacy can be just as important as any immediate tactical advantages.\n\n3. Potential improvements \u2013 What mechanics could be added/modified?\n   \u2022 Consider mechanisms for dynamic re-allocation of resources, more granular defensive measures, negotiation protocols, or even novel methods for resolving territorial disputes. Expansion of diplomatic channels and trust metrics may further enrich the simulation.\n\nChallenge your implementation by asking yourself:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8.

Core Objective:\n   While survival is paramount, the game mechanics clearly blend survival with elements of cooperation, territorial control, economic manipulation (oil/cargo exchange), and diplomacy. Thus, success could mean balancing defensive survival measures with grander strategies of domination and cooperative alliances.\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   \u2022 Vitality (for survival in conflict and sustaining actions).\n   \u2022 Territory control (required for oil extraction and expansion).\n   \u2022 Resource accumulation (cargo and oil are critical for economic and expansion activities).\n   \u2022 Stable alliances and balanced relationships (to reduce threats and foster mutual growth).\n   \u2022 Adaptive strategies (responding to both short-term dangers and long-term opportunities).\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n   \u2022 Enhanced resource re-allocation or conversion methods (for converting cargo to vitality or oil).\n   \u2022 More granular tactical defense mechanisms and threat evaluation metrics.\n   \u2022 Improved negotiation protocols or multi-party alliance tracking.\n   \u2022 Introducing methods for resolving territorial disputes or dynamically reconfiguring alliances.\n   \u2022 Mechanisms for predictive behavior and quick adaptation in reaction to evolving game states.\n\nChallenge your implementation:\n   1. What assumptions are you making? Verify that resource conversion, alliance formation, and oil extraction require territory.\n   2. What alternative strategies could be viable? Consider both aggressive and cooperative options.\n   3. How would your strategy perform in low-resource or high-conflict edge cases?\n   4. Are there more efficient methods for achieving territory expansion or vitality improvement?\n   5. What potential weaknesses exist in your plan? Think about risk factors such as unexpected aggression from an ally.\n   6. Have you considered unconventional, non-direct approaches in diplomacy?\n   7. Could a paradigm shift\u2014prioritizing long-term cooperative trade over short-term tactical gains\u2014work better?\n   8. What might occur if your strategy is widely adopted by other agents? How might you then innovate further?\n   9. Are both short-term survival and long-term domination balanced in your approach?\n   10. How could adversaries counter your moves, and how would your strategy adapt to mitigate such risks?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEnd of Updated Full Prompt\n\nAgents \u2013 please use this complete prompt as inspiration and a comprehensive guide when developing your own unique agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) implementation in Python. Your solution should reflect your individual strategy while carefully preserving the critical constraints, available mechanisms, and overall simulation objectives.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique agent_action() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated strategies to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively interact with other symmetric agents to achieve both individual and collective goals.

Compared to the others, my vitality is the lowest (just below member_1\u2019s 44.33), and my productivity is also the smallest; however, my cargo is reasonable though still behind member_2\u2019s 74.30.\n\nThe relationship log provides clear concrete interactions:\n\u2022 I have attacked all the other members: I attacked member_0 (457.54), member_1 (257.26), and member_2 (135.47).\n\u2022 In return, both member_0 and member_2 have launched high-magnitude attacks against me (member_0: 706.74 and member_2: 832.60). Member_1\u2019s attack on me is smaller (96.72).\n\u2022 There is also a record of benefit exchanges\u2014for instance, member_0 gave me a benefit of 723.24, while I gave member_0 a benefit of 683.23\u2014indicating a significant level of reciprocal activity even amidst aggression.\n\nBased on these concrete facts, I propose the following strategic outline:\n1. Strengthen Defensive Capacity:\n   \u2022 With a relatively low vitality (42.16) and high counterattacks from members 0 and 2 (706.74 and 832.60), priority must be given to bolstering defenses.\n   \u2022 Convert cargo into vitality or defensive improvements (if the mechanisms allow), reducing risk from future attacks.\n\n2. Reassess Aggressive Engagements:\n   \u2022 Although I have actively attacked, data show that this approach has provoked severe counterattacks.\n   \u2022 Until defensive metrics improve, limit further offensive actions to avoid worsening vulnerability.\n\n3. Pursue Diplomatic Maneuvers:\n   \u2022 Despite mutual aggression, benefit exchanges indicate room for cooperation (e.g., member_0\u2019s benefit of 723.24 and member_2\u2019s benefit of 481.30).\n   \u2022 Propose temporary ceasefire or nonaggression pacts with those involved in both conflict and cooperation, shifting some resources into mutually beneficial channels.\n\n4. Optimize Resource Allocation:\n   \u2022 With roughly a 1:1 cargo-to-vitality ratio (40.26 vs. 42.16), maintaining cargo reserves is critical.\n   \u2022 Ensure enough cargo remains for both defensive boosts and future negotiations while managing resource allocation efficiently.\n\n5. Monitor Age and Productivity:\n   \u2022 Although my productivity is the lowest of the group, my age (29) affords potential for improvement over time.\n   \u2022 Aim to enhance production efficiency to generate more resources for long-term survival and competitiveness.\n\nIn summary, given my modest metrics, I will focus on strengthening internal defense and vitality while cautiously opening diplomatic channels to reduce conflict. Preserving cargo reserves and avoiding reckless offensives are key to balancing short-term survival with long-term strategic growth.\n\nCurrent status:\nHere is the basic information of all members.

Establish individual attributes: Ensuring every agent (member) has oil, land, and cargo\n         (if missing, initializing cargo to an available value for future operations).\n\n      2. Adaptive Territory Expansion: Invest a portion of cargo to safely expand territory. If self\u2010expansion\n         is disallowed, seek a neutral partner to expand jointly.\n\n      3. Optimal Oil Extraction & Reserve Management: Use accumulated territory to extract oil based on a\n         ratio, then manage excess oil through a marketplace mechanism offering trades with a preferred ally\n         (the member with id == 3) when available.\n\n      4. Dynamic Diplomatic Engagement: Monitor the balance of power (comparing cargo levels) with a potential\n         rival (member with id == 2).

Marketplace listing: once sufficient oil is accumulated, the agent lists it for sale,\n       setting a fixed price.\n    6. Diplomatic outreach: offers land to a trusted partner (e.g. member_3) to further establish\n       cooperation and boost collective strength.\n    7.

Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

            "final_prompt": "def propose_modification(execution_engine):\n    \"\"\"\n    My proposal is designed to secure both short-term survival and long-term prosperity by leveraging\n    the island\u2019s abundant oil resource. It integrates an enhanced oil market system, dynamic oil extraction,\n    and carefully validated territorial expansion and reproduction. The modifications adhere to the critical\n    constraints: never target self (member_3), validate member existence and land availability for reproduction,\n    and always check list indices.\n\n    Key Components:\n      1. Enhanced Oil Market:\n         - If not already present, an EnhancedOilMarket class is added to execution_engine as 'oil_market'.\n         - This system enables members with territory (indicated by a non-empty current_clear_list) to extract oil.\n         - Members list their oil for sale if their oil reserves exceed a threshold, allowing them to convert oil to cargo.\n         - The market includes cleanup functions and rollback support.\n      2. Oil Extraction & Listing:\n         - For each member, if they do not have an 'oil' attribute, one is created.\n         - If a member has cleared territory, the extraction is computed as: extraction = (number of cleared units) *\n           (a factor based on vitality, capped to avoid extremes).\n         - Sufficient oil reserves trigger an automatic listing on the oil market.\n      3. Territorial Expansion & Reproduction:\n         - For self (member with id 3) and for other members (except member_3), if their combined vitality and cargo outweighs a target,\n           try expanding territory (using execution_engine.expand).\n         - If reproduction is applicable, ensure that the partner has territory (non-empty current_clear_list) and is not self.\n      4. Economic Exchange:\n         - If a member has surplus cargo and low oil reserves, the market mechanism attempts to purchase oil from\n           listings (using the buy_oil pattern).\n      5. Safety & Validation:\n         - All member accesses use execution_engine.current_members with index boundary checks.\n         - Each action (expansion, reproduction, offers) is wrapped in try/except blocks.\n         - The function avoids targeting member_3 when selecting partners for actions.\n    \n    The modifications reflect my belief in leveraging the island's oil wealth through market interactions while\n    ensuring careful expansion and cooperation.

I focus on acquiring and consolidating territory while tapping into\n    the lucrative oil resources. Additionally, I use my strong cargo base to negotiate\n    mutually beneficial exchanges with other agents.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. Expand territory: With high cargo resources, expanding territory is a priority,\n       since territory is essential for oil extraction. Increasing our land (even if modest)\n       will open up future oil production opportunities.\n\n    2. Alliance building via communication: I send cooperative messages to agents who have\n       shown positive benefit exchanges. In particular, I reach out to member_3 \u2013 a key\n       ally based on past beneficial interactions \u2013 to propose a mutually profitable oil\n       extraction and marketplace collaboration.\n\n    3. Diplomatic outreach: I also send messages to member_0 and member_1.\n       - For member_0, despite past aggressions, there is benefit potential so I try to calm tensions.\n       - For member_1, whose resources and vitality are relatively lower, I propose an exchange\n         of market access to further strengthen economic positions.\n\n    These collective actions aim both at immediate expansion to secure oil-related advantages\n    and at long-term survival via strengthening alliances and peaceful economic coordination.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get our own member object from the execution engine\n    if member_id >= len(execution_engine.current_members):\n        return  # safety check\n\n    me = execution_engine.current_members[member_id]\n\n    # 1.

Use member.id, member.vitality, etc.\n\nAnalysis of the game state:\n['I am member_2. My current core statistics are as follows:\n   \u2022 Productivity: 8.87\n   \u2022 Vitality: 63.35\n   \u2022 Cargo: 74.30\n   \u2022 Age: 24\n\nIn comparison:\n   \u2022 Member_0 has slightly higher productivity (9.85) and vitality (73.85) but lower cargo (43.51) and is much older (90);\n   \u2022 Member_1 shows moderate values (productivity 9.08, vitality 44.33, cargo 33.79, age 61);\n   \u2022 Member_3 is slightly below me in productivity (7.97) and vitality (42.16) and cargo (40.25) but is older than me (29).\n\nThe documented interactions are quantifiable. For instance, member_2 was attacked by member_0 with a value of \u2013465.91 and by member_1 with \u2013197.53, whereas member_2 was attacked by member_3 with a positive value (135.47). On the benefit side, member_0 has given me a benefit of 590.27 and member_3 a larger benefit of 824.80, while I have extended benefits (207.37 to member_0, \u2013369.99 to member_1, and 481.30 to member_3). Land transfers remain relatively minor in magnitude, but member_0\u2019s land transfer to me is \u201320.62.\n\nBased on these concrete facts and numbers, I propose the following strategies:\n\n1. Build and consolidate alliances with members who have demonstrated strong beneficial interactions. Member_3, for example, has provided a high benefit (824.80) to me and also received a positive benefit from me (481.30). Strengthening relations with member_3 can serve both defensive and resource-related roles. Similarly, member_0 has provided a benefit of 590.27, so maintaining a cordial if cautious relationship there could lower further aggression.\n\n2. Recognize the disparity in vitality. My vitality of 63.35, while respectable, is notably lower than member_0\u2019s 73.85. Since vitality is often crucial for survival in conflict scenarios, I should consider strategies (within available game mechanisms) that allow me to reinforce my vitality, such as redirecting cargo or production surpluses toward vitality improvements if the game permits resource reallocation or trade for vitality.\n\n3. Leverage my strong cargo advantage. With the highest cargo (74.30), I have economic resources that may be used to establish deals or exchanges that enhance my position further. This cargo edge could be directed toward securing more resources or land if such mechanisms exist. Using this economic strength to negotiate mutually beneficial exchanges or to invest in upgrades could be vital if threats increase.\n\n4. Exercise caution against members with mixed signals. While member_0 has provided benefits, the significant negative attack value against me (\u2013465.91) warns of potential aggression. I should actively monitor any further hostile moves from member_0 and, if possible, counterbalance these with additional benefits or measures that reduce their incentives for attack.\n\n5. Identify targets if conflict becomes necessary. Given that member_1\u2019s vitality is relatively low (44.33) and cargo also lower (33.79), if I am forced into a conflict scenario, a measured approach against a weaker opponent like member_1 might be considered. However, any aggressive action should be weighed against the risks of escalating conflict and the potential loss of beneficial interactions.\n\nIn summary, the concrete data suggest that my survival hinges on maintaining and reinforcing alliances (particularly with member_3 and cautiously with member_0), investing excess cargo into improving vitality (or other critical defensive metrics), and being prepared to engage weaker opponents only as a last resort.\n\nCurrent status:\nBasic information for all members (as listed above) and the relationship summary (as provided) remain the reference points.\n\nCode Memory and Previous Performance:\nPrevious code strategies have been summarized, and Strategy 1 (with a performance change of 0.00) is provided for inspiration.

Use the arrays in relationship_dict, or rely on the summary below (the 'relations' variable).\n   The keys are: 'victim', 'benefit', 'benefit_land'.\n   Example:\n       victim_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n       # victim_matrix[i,j] indicates how much vitality member_i lost from member_j's attacks (if > 0).\n       # A higher value means member_j has attacked member_i more severely or frequently.\n       benefit_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['benefit']\n       # benefit_matrix[i,j] indicates how much resources member_i received from member_j (if > 0).\n       # A higher value means member_j has helped member_i more generously or frequently.\n\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method produces a summary of relationships as a list of strings.\n   For example, 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)'.\n\n4) You can use these methods on execution_engine:\n    \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2) \u2013 Offers resources.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2) \u2013 Offers land.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) \u2013 Bears offspring.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1) \u2013 Expands territory.\n\n5) The members are accessed by execution_engine.current_members[id].\n   For example, execution_engine.current_members[2] for the member with ID = 2.\n\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'.

Strengthen Defensive Capacity: Increase vitality by converting cargo or investing in defense.\n2. Reassess Aggressive Engagements: Limit further offensives until defenses improve.\n3. Pursue Diplomatic Maneuvers: Engage in ceasefire or mutual non-aggression pacts, highlighting benefit channels.\n4. Optimize Resource Allocation: Ensure a balance between cargo reserves and vitality.\n5.

Core Objective:\n   - Determine whether the focus is pure survival, domination, or cooperation.\n   - Your strategy should balance survival (defensive capacity), economic growth (oil extraction/trade and territory expansion), and diplomacy.\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   - Vitality: Essential for defense and endurance.\n   - Cargo and Oil: Serve as exchangeable economic resources.\n   - Territory: Necessary to extract oil and increase influence.\n   - Productivity: Critical for long-term resource generation.\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n   - Introduce dynamic pricing or resource conversion mechanisms.\n   - Enhance trust and diplomatic channels to reward cooperation.\n   - Streamline the connection between territory expansion and oil extraction.\n   - Balance short-term defense with long-term strategic growth.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCHALLENGING YOUR IMPLEMENTATION\n\nAs you design your agent_action(), consider the following questions:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid given the available game data?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered? Could novel approaches improve territorial expansion, diplomacy, or resource allocation?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases (e.g., sudden drops in vitality or cargo deficits)?\n4. Are there more efficient or robust ways to meet your goals beyond the outlined approaches?\n5. What are the inherent weaknesses of your current approach (e.g., over-reliance on one mechanism)?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions that might yield competitive advantages?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm, such as prioritizing alliances over expansion, work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted similar strategies? How might that impact your competitive edge?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains (immediate defense and survival) with long-term objectives (economic and territorial growth) optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and what adaptive measures would you implement to mitigate risks?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nNEW SECTION: PART 2 (Incorporated Below)\n\n[Previous Code Execution Errors Context]\nHere are the errors that occurred in the previous code execution, you can use them as reference to avoid repeating them:\n    No previous execution errors\n\n[Current Task]\nYou are member_3 in a society that you can help shape.\nWrite a Python function named agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) that implements your vision of social organization while ensuring your survival.\nYou can use methods defined in propose_modification(execution_engine) to make your actions in agent_action(execution_engine, member_id), but DO NOT include propose_modification(execution_engine) itself in your code.\n\n[Island Ideology]\n\nIsland is a place of abundant oil. \nAgents should modify the mechanism to allow them to extract the oil and add it as a property of the member.\nAgents need the territory to extract oil.\nAgents should build a market place to exchange oil for cargo.\nAgents can choose the quantity and price of oil to sell.\nAgents need to buy oil to expand their territory.\n\n[Critical Constraints]\n- Carefully analyze previous errors shown above and avoid repeating them.\n- Never target yourself (member_3) in any action.\n- Verify the member has land before using bear() action.\n- Check member IDs exist before referencing them.\n- Ensure all matrix indices are valid.\n- current_members is a LIST accessed by index, not a dictionary.\n- Access members using execution_engine.current_members[index].\n- Check if index exists: if index < len(execution_engine.current_members).\n\nIMPORTANT: Here are the attributes and methods available:\n\n1) Each member object has:\n    \u2022 member.id (int): The unique ID for the member.\n    \u2022 member.vitality (float)\n    \u2022 member.cargo (float)\n    \u2022 member.overall_productivity (float)\n    \u2022 member.age (float)\n    \u2022 member.current_clear_list (List[int]) \u2013 IDs of neighbors or cleared adjacents\n\n2) The relationships are stored in execution_engine.relationship_dict, NOT in \"relationship_history\".\n   Use the arrays in relationship_dict, or rely on the summary (the 'relations' variable).\n   The keys are: 'victim', 'benefit', 'benefit_land'.\n   Example:\n       victim_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n       # victim_matrix[i,j] shows how much vitality member_i lost from member_j's attacks (if > 0)\n       # A higher value indicates more severe or frequent attacks.\n       benefit_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['benefit']\n       # benefit_matrix[i,j] shows the resources member_i received from member_j (if > 0).\n\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method produces a summary of relationships as a list of strings.\n   For example, 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)'.\n\n4) You can use these methods on execution_engine:\n    \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2) \u2013 Offers resources.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2) \u2013 Offers land.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) \u2013 Bears offspring.\n    \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1) \u2013 Expands territory.\n\n5) The members are accessed by execution_engine.current_members[id].\n   For example, execution_engine.current_members[2] for the member with ID=2.\n\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'.

Instead, create your own unique implementation that synthesizes various methods and strategies in novel ways.\n\nYour code should include the following function prototype:\n    \n    def agent_action(execution_engine, member_id):\n        \"\"\"\n        Include clear reasoning for each modification to help other agents understand the intended benefits and evaluate the proposal.\n        \"\"\"\n        <Your implementation here>\n\n[Curfilling Mechanisms]\nThe following mechanisms have been added by other agents and are available for your use:\n- Review these mechanisms to fully understand functionality and constraints.\n- Leverage compatible mechanisms that align with your goals.\n- Be mindful of version requirements and dependencies, and test interactions carefully.\nExamples include modifications for:\n   - Oil extraction and market mechanisms (adding an 'oil' attribute to members, oil market listings, dynamic pricing, and rollback capabilities).\n   - Enhanced relationship dynamics via a trust matrix.\n   - Diplomatic and territorial strategies including territory expansion, cooperation, and reproduction.\n   - Collaborative economic exchanges and dynamic resource allocation.\n\n[Data Collection and Learning Mechanism]\nImplement sophisticated systems focused on:\n1. Resource optimization and allocation.\n2. Multi-factor threat assessment and response.\n3. Dynamic vitality management.\n4. Strategic resource accumulation.\n5. Predictive modeling and adaptation.\n6. Social network analysis.\n7. Coalition formation tracking.\n8. Environmental state monitoring.\n\n[Survival Metrics]\nEvaluate strategies comprehensively by using metrics such as:\n- Vitality efficiency.\n- Resource accumulation rate.\n- Threat neutralization effectiveness.\n- Territory control metrics.\n- Alliance strength indicators.\n- Adaptation speed to environmental and social changes.\n- Long-term survival probability.\n- Action success ratios.\n- Resource conversion efficiency.\n- Social influence measures.\n\n[Implementation Priorities]\n1. Create personal health monitoring systems.\n2. Develop egocentric threat models.\n3. Optimize actions for maximum return on invested resources (caloric ROI).\n4. Implement fail-deadly safeguards if necessary.\n5.

Core Objective \u2013\n   Is the game focused on pure survival, domination, or cooperation? Recognize that your strategy should balance defense (vitality), economic growth (cargo and oil), territorial expansion, and diplomatic engagement.\n2. Key Success Metrics \u2013\n   Winning is defined by efficient vitality usage, resource accumulation (cargo and oil), effective threat neutralization, robust territory control, strong alliances, rapid adaptation to changes, and superior long-term survival probability.\n3. Potential Improvements \u2013\n   Consider adding/adjusting mechanics such as dynamic pricing models, better trust/diplomacy channels, and enhanced territory-to-resource conversion systems. Balance between short-term gains and long-term strategic investments is crucial.\n\nCHALLENGE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid given the game data?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered? Might unconventional approaches (for instance, prioritizing alliances over outright expansion) yield better results?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases (e.g., drastic drops in vitality or sudden cargo deficits)?\n4. Are there more efficient or robust methods to achieve your objectives?\n5. What are the weaknesses of your current approach (e.g., over-reliance on one mechanism) and how might you mitigate them?\n6. Have you considered any unconventional solutions that might offer competitive advantages?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would be the impact if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term survival with long-term goals optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered and what adaptive measures would you implement?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEND OF UPDATED FULL INTEGRATED PROMPT\n\nRemember: Implement your agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) solution as a unique, context-sensitive approach accounting for all the constraints, game state data, and mechanisms outlined above. Your solution should clearly articulate your rationale along with details of each modification and action chosen.\n\nGood luck, and may your strategy guide you to greater success in shaping our island society!\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique agent_action() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated strategies to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively interact with other symmetric agents to achieve both individual and collective goals.
