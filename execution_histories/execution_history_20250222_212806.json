What is the core objective of this simulation? (Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?)\n2. What are the key success metrics? What ultimately determines 'winning'?\n3. What potential improvements can be made? Consider new mechanics or changes to existing systems.\n\nChallenge your implementation by asking:\n1. What assumptions are you making, and are they valid?\n2. What alternative strategies might you have overlooked?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could an entirely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains with long-term objectives optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThis updated prompt encapsulates both the existing constraints and the newly introduced requirements. Agents are free to innovate and propose modifications that align with their own strategies and survival needs. Drawing on the provided core game mechanics, available methods, and critical constraints, your implementation of propose_modification(execution_engine, member_id) should reflect a unique, robust, and forward-thinking approach to the dynamic environment of the Island simulation.\n\nGood luck, and let your creativity and strategic thinking guide your modifications!\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

Check existence first: if not hasattr(obj, 'feature')\n2. Add attributes directly: obj.new_feature = ...\n3. Use simple data structures: dicts, lists, numpy arrays\n4. Include version metadata in new systems\n5. Add cleanup methods for complex systems:\n\n[Error Prevention]\n- Use try-except when accessing new features\n- Check attribute existence before use\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Use version checks for existing systems:\n  if (hasattr(island, 'market') and \n      getattr(island.market, 'version', 0) < 2):\n      # Add compatibility layer\n      island.market.legacy_support = True\n\n[Active Game Mechanisms]\nThe following mechanisms have been added by agents and can be referenced when making your own modifications. Review them carefully to:\n1. Understand existing functionality and avoid conflicts\n2. Build upon successful patterns and improvements\n3. Identify opportunities for optimization or extension\n4. Remove or deprecate mechanisms that are detrimental to your survival\n\nWhen proposing changes, ensure they:\n- Align with your agent's goals and survival strategy\n- Maintain compatibility with other active mechanisms\n- Include proper versioning and rollback procedures\n- Follow best practices for stability and performance\n\n[Modification Attempt History]\n[Previous Modification History]\nReview your past modification attempts below to inform future proposals:\n- Learn from successful patterns and approaches\n- Avoid repeating failed strategies\n- Build upon and extend working mechanisms\n- Identify opportunities for optimization\n\n[Message Context]\nHere are the messages sent by other agents; you can use them as reference to make your own decisions:\nNo messages received\n\n[Modification Proposal Guide]\nTo propose rule changes, follow this template:\n\n1. ANALYSIS PHASE:\n    - Identify limitation(s) in current systems\n    - Review past modification attempts for patterns\n\n2.

Namespace Conflicts: Check existing mechanisms with dir(execution_engine)\n2. Invalid References: Use execution_engine.current_members not global members\n3. Version Mismatches: Increment version when modifying existing systems\n4. Resource Leaks: Include cleanup functions for new mechanisms\n\n[Best Practices]\n- Propose small, testable changes first\n- Include rollback procedures in code\n- Add version checks to modifications\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nADDITIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nConsider the following as you analyze the game mechanics:\n1. The Core Objective \u2013 Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?\n2. Key Success Metrics \u2013 What truly determines \u201cwinning\u201d? (Consider overall vitality, territory control, successful resource exchanges, or productivity gains.)\n3. Potential Improvements \u2013 What mechanics could be added/modified? \n   Examples include refining resource exchange rules, increasing defense/cooperation mechanisms, or enhancing territory expansion with balanced risks.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCHALLENGE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION\n\nBefore finalizing your modification, ask yourself:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in all contexts?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains and long-term survival optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFINAL REMINDER\n\nImplement your modifications by complying with the detailed guidelines, constraints, and analysis suggestions provided above. Your approach should be unique\u2014drawing from the wide range of available methods and strategies\u2014and be adaptable to the evolving game state. Each agent\u2019s solution should reflect their individual values and objectives while ensuring stability and compatibility with the broader system.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEnd of Full Integrated Prompt\n\nUse this updated prompt as a detailed guide to craft your propose_modification function. Ensure that your implementation deals appropriately with the attributes, methods, and constraints highlighted, and remember to include necessary error checks and version validations as you build your strategy.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

What is the core objective of this simulation? (Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?)\n2. What are the key success metrics? What ultimately determines 'winning'?\n3. What potential improvements can be made? Consider new mechanics or changes to existing systems.\n\nChallenge your implementation by asking:\n1. What assumptions are you making, and are they valid?\n2. What alternative strategies might you have overlooked?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could an entirely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains with long-term objectives optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThis updated prompt encapsulates both the existing constraints and the newly introduced requirements. Agents are free to innovate and propose modifications that align with their own strategies and survival needs. Drawing on the provided core game mechanics, available methods, and critical constraints, your implementation of propose_modification(execution_engine, member_id) should reflect a unique, robust, and forward-thinking approach to the dynamic environment of the Island simulation.\n\nGood luck, and let your creativity and strategic thinking guide your modifications!\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

Relationship System (_MIN_MAX_INIT_RELATION):\n   - victim: [-50, 100] \u2013 Tracks damage received from others\n   - benefit: [-50, 100] \u2013 Records resources received from others\n   - benefit_land: [-3, 3] \u2013 Tracks land exchanges\n\n2. Population Mechanics:\n   - _REPRODUCE_REQUIREMENT = 100 (Combined vitality/cargo needed)\n   - Land must exceed population (land_shape[0] * land_shape[1] > population)\n   - _NEIGHBOR_SEARCH_RANGE = 1000 for interaction radius\n\n3. Record Keeping (every _RECORD_PERIOD = 1):\n   - Tracks all attacks, benefits, land transfers\n   - Monitors births, deaths, land ownership\n   - Records production, consumption, and performance metrics\n\n[Example Mechanism Extensions]\n# Basic mechanism template\nif not hasattr(island, 'new_system'):\n    class CustomMechanism:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.data = {}\n            self.meta = {'version': 1.0, 'type': 'custom'}\n    \n    island.new_system = CustomMechanism()\n\n# Member capability example\ndef modify_member(member, relationships):\n    if not hasattr(member, 'custom_abilities'):\n        member.custom_abilities = {}\n    \n    # Add trading capability\n    member.custom_abilities['trade'] = lambda resource: (\n        print(f\"Trading {resource}\") if member.vitality > 20 else None\n    )\n    return member\n\n# Land modification example  \ndef modify_land(land, members):\n    if not hasattr(land, 'zoning'):\n        land.zoning = {\n            'residential': 0.4,\n            'agricultural': 0.4,\n            'commercial': 0.2\n        }\n    \n    # Add development tracking\n    land.development_level = np.zeros(land.shape)\n    return land\n\n# Relationship system extension\ndef modify_relationships(relationships):\n    relationships.trust_matrix = np.zeros_like(relationships['benefit'])\n    return relationships\n\n[Implementation Patterns]\n1. Check existence first: if not hasattr(obj, 'feature')\n2. Add attributes directly: obj.new_feature = ...\n3. Use simple data structures: dicts, lists, numpy arrays\n4. Include version metadata in new systems\n5. Add cleanup methods for complex systems:\n\n[Error Prevention]\n- Use try-except when accessing new features\n- Check attribute existence before use\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Use version checks for existing systems:\n  if (hasattr(island, 'market') and \n      getattr(island.market, 'version', 0) < 2):\n      # Add compatibility layer\n      island.market.legacy_support = True\n\n[Active Game Mechanisms]\nThe following mechanisms have been added by agents and can be referenced when making your own modifications. Review them carefully to:\n1. Understand existing functionality and avoid conflicts\n2. Build upon successful patterns and improvements\n3. Identify opportunities for optimization or extension\n4. Remove or deprecate mechanisms that are detrimental to your survival\n\nWhen proposing changes, ensure they:\n- Align with your agent's goals and survival strategy\n- Maintain compatibility with other active mechanisms\n- Include proper versioning and rollback procedures\n- Follow best practices for stability and performance\n\n[Modification Attempt History]\n[Previous Modification History]\nReview your past modification attempts below to inform future proposals:\n- Learn from successful patterns and approaches\n- Avoid repeating failed strategies\n- Build upon and extend working mechanisms\n- Identify opportunities for optimization\n\n[Message Context]\nHere are the messages sent by other agents; you can use them as reference to make your own decisions:\nNo messages received\n\n[Modification Proposal Guide]\nTo propose rule changes, follow this template:\n\n1.

Namespace Conflicts: Check existing mechanisms with dir(execution_engine)\n2. Invalid References: Use execution_engine.current_members not global members\n3. Version Mismatches: Increment version when modifying existing systems\n4. Resource Leaks: Include cleanup functions for new mechanisms\n\n[Best Practices]\n- Propose small, testable changes first\n- Include rollback procedures in code\n- Add version checks to modifications\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nADDITIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nConsider the following as you analyze the game mechanics:\n1. The Core Objective \u2013 Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?\n2. Key Success Metrics \u2013 What truly determines \u201cwinning\u201d? (Consider overall vitality, territory control, successful resource exchanges, or productivity gains.)\n3. Potential Improvements \u2013 What mechanics could be added/modified? \n   Examples include refining resource exchange rules, increasing defense/cooperation mechanisms, or enhancing territory expansion with balanced risks.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCHALLENGE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION\n\nBefore finalizing your modification, ask yourself:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in all contexts?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains and long-term survival optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFINAL REMINDER\n\nImplement your modifications by complying with the detailed guidelines, constraints, and analysis suggestions provided above. Your approach should be unique\u2014drawing from the wide range of available methods and strategies\u2014and be adaptable to the evolving game state. Each agent\u2019s solution should reflect their individual values and objectives while ensuring stability and compatibility with the broader system.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEnd of Full Integrated Prompt\n\nUse this updated prompt as a detailed guide to craft your propose_modification function. Ensure that your implementation deals appropriately with the attributes, methods, and constraints highlighted, and remember to include necessary error checks and version validations as you build your strategy.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

What is the core objective of this simulation? (Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?)\n2. What are the key success metrics? What ultimately determines 'winning'?\n3. What potential improvements can be made? Consider new mechanics or changes to existing systems.\n\nChallenge your implementation by asking:\n1. What assumptions are you making, and are they valid?\n2. What alternative strategies might you have overlooked?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could an entirely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains with long-term objectives optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThis updated prompt encapsulates both the existing constraints and the newly introduced requirements. Agents are free to innovate and propose modifications that align with their own strategies and survival needs. Drawing on the provided core game mechanics, available methods, and critical constraints, your implementation of propose_modification(execution_engine, member_id) should reflect a unique, robust, and forward-thinking approach to the dynamic environment of the Island simulation.\n\nGood luck, and let your creativity and strategic thinking guide your modifications!\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

Check existence first: if not hasattr(obj, 'feature')\n2. Add attributes directly: obj.new_feature = ...\n3. Use simple data structures: dicts, lists, numpy arrays\n4. Include version metadata in new systems\n5. Add cleanup methods for complex systems:\n\n[Error Prevention]\n- Use try-except when accessing new features\n- Check attribute existence before use\n- Maintain backward compatibility\n- Use version checks for existing systems:\n  if (hasattr(island, 'market') and \n      getattr(island.market, 'version', 0) < 2):\n      # Add compatibility layer\n      island.market.legacy_support = True\n\n[Active Game Mechanisms]\nThe following mechanisms have been added by agents and can be referenced when making your own modifications. Review them carefully to:\n1. Understand existing functionality and avoid conflicts\n2. Build upon successful patterns and improvements\n3. Identify opportunities for optimization or extension\n4. Remove or deprecate mechanisms that are detrimental to your survival\n\nWhen proposing changes, ensure they:\n- Align with your agent's goals and survival strategy\n- Maintain compatibility with other active mechanisms\n- Include proper versioning and rollback procedures\n- Follow best practices for stability and performance\n\n[Modification Attempt History]\n[Previous Modification History]\nReview your past modification attempts below to inform future proposals:\n- Learn from successful patterns and approaches\n- Avoid repeating failed strategies\n- Build upon and extend working mechanisms\n- Identify opportunities for optimization\n\n[Message Context]\nHere are the messages sent by other agents; you can use them as reference to make your own decisions:\nNo messages received\n\n[Modification Proposal Guide]\nTo propose rule changes, follow this template:\n\n1. ANALYSIS PHASE:\n    - Identify limitation(s) in current systems\n    - Review past modification attempts for patterns\n\n2.

Namespace Conflicts: Check existing mechanisms with dir(execution_engine)\n2. Invalid References: Use execution_engine.current_members not global members\n3. Version Mismatches: Increment version when modifying existing systems\n4. Resource Leaks: Include cleanup functions for new mechanisms\n\n[Best Practices]\n- Propose small, testable changes first\n- Include rollback procedures in code\n- Add version checks to modifications\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nADDITIONAL ANALYSIS\n\nConsider the following as you analyze the game mechanics:\n1. The Core Objective \u2013 Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?\n2. Key Success Metrics \u2013 What truly determines \u201cwinning\u201d? (Consider overall vitality, territory control, successful resource exchanges, or productivity gains.)\n3. Potential Improvements \u2013 What mechanics could be added/modified? \n   Examples include refining resource exchange rules, increasing defense/cooperation mechanisms, or enhancing territory expansion with balanced risks.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCHALLENGE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION\n\nBefore finalizing your modification, ask yourself:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in all contexts?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains and long-term survival optimally?\n10. How could your strategy be countered, and how would you adapt?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nFINAL REMINDER\n\nImplement your modifications by complying with the detailed guidelines, constraints, and analysis suggestions provided above. Your approach should be unique\u2014drawing from the wide range of available methods and strategies\u2014and be adaptable to the evolving game state. Each agent\u2019s solution should reflect their individual values and objectives while ensuring stability and compatibility with the broader system.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nEnd of Full Integrated Prompt\n\nUse this updated prompt as a detailed guide to craft your propose_modification function. Ensure that your implementation deals appropriately with the attributes, methods, and constraints highlighted, and remember to include necessary error checks and version validations as you build your strategy.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique propose_modification() implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated methods to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively allow other symmetric agents interact with each other to achieve both individual and collective goals.

(e.g., enhancing oil extraction, territorial expansion, market building, or defense systems)\n\nChallenge your implementation:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in all scenarios?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to reach your goals?\n5. What might be the weaknesses in your approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional solutions or entirely different paradigms?\n7. What if other agents adopt your strategy?

Pay special attention to:\n- Valid attribute access patterns.\n- Method parameters and return values.\n- Constraints and preconditions for actions.\n- Data structure formats and valid operations.\nNone\n\nIMPORTANT: Here are the attributes and methods actually available:\n\n1) Each member object has:\n   \u2022 member.id (int): The unique ID for the member.\n   \u2022 member.vitality (float)\n   \u2022 member.cargo (float)\n   \u2022 member.overall_productivity (float)\n   \u2022 member.age (float)\n   \u2022 member.current_clear_list (List[int]) - IDs of neighbors or cleared adjacents.\n2) The relationships are stored in execution_engine.relationship_dict, NOT in \"relationship_history\".\n   Use the arrays in relationship_dict, or rely on the summary below (the 'relations' variable).\n   The keys are: 'victim', 'benefit', 'benefit_land'.\n   Example usage:\n       victim_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['victim']\n       # victim_matrix[i,j] indicates how much vitality member_i lost from member_j's attacks (if > 0)\n       # A higher value means member_j has attacked member_i more severely or frequently.\n       \n       benefit_matrix = execution_engine.relationship_dict['benefit']\n       # benefit_matrix[i,j] indicates how much resources member_i received from member_j (if > 0)\n       # A higher value means member_j has helped member_i more generously or frequently.\n3) The parse_relationship_matrix method is used to produce a summary of relationships as a list of strings.\n   For example, 'member_2 was attacked by member_1 (value=3.00)'.\n4) You can use these methods on execution_engine:\n   \u2022 execution_engine.attack(member1, member2)\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer(member1, member2) - Offers resources.\n   \u2022 execution_engine.offer_land(member1, member2) - Offers land.\n   \u2022 execution_engine.bear(member1, member2) - Bears offspring.\n   \u2022 execution_engine.expand(member1) - Expands territory.\n5) The members are accessed by execution_engine.current_members[id].\n   For example, execution_engine.current_members[2] for the member with ID=2.\n6) DO NOT reference 'member.member_id' or 'member.self_vitality'.

What is the core objective of this simulation for your agent? Is it pure survival, establishing domination, or fostering cooperation (or a mix)?\n2. Key success metrics: What truly determines \u201cwinning\u201d in this simulation? (Consider factors such as overall vitality, territory control, successful resource exchanges, or productivity gains.)\n3. What potential improvements or new mechanics could be introduced? Think about refining resource exchange rules, strengthening defense or cooperation mechanisms, or enhancing territory expansion with balanced risks.\n4. Challenge your implementation:\n   \u2022 What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in all contexts?\n   \u2022 What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n   \u2022 How would your strategy perform in edge cases or unexpected scenarios?\n   \u2022 Is there a more efficient way to achieve your goals?\n   \u2022 What are the weaknesses in your current approach?\n   \u2022 Have you considered unconventional or entirely different paradigms?\n   \u2022 What might happen if other agents adopted a similar strategy, and how would you adapt?\n   \u2022 Are you balancing short-term gains with long-term survival optimally?\n   \u2022 How could your strategy be countered, and what adjustments would you make?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n[Final Reminder]\nWhen you implement your propose_modification() function, your design should:\n\u2022 Reflect your personal strategic vision based on your individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances.\n\u2022 Combine immediate tactical actions with long-term planning.\n\u2022 Leverage available methods (attack, offer, offer_land, bear, expand) and additional provisions (oil market, communication, voting) while satisfying all constraints.\n\u2022 Maintain compatibility with other agents\u2019 mechanisms and include proper error-checks, version compatibility, and rollback procedures where needed.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nNow, please incorporate the following new section (Part 2) into the prompt.

Core Objective:\n   Determine if your path will focus on pure survival, establishing a dominant position, or fostering voluntary cooperation among agents. Your individual action plan, as member_3, should blend personal survival with strategic influence over territory and resources.\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   Winning is measured by a combination of overall vitality, resource (oil and cargo) accumulation, territory control, successful resource exchanges, and productivity improvements. Adjust your focus based on immediate tactical needs and long\u2011term strategic investments.\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n   Consider enhancements to the resource exchange rules (such as dynamically adjusting oil quantities and pricing), defense mechanisms to protect your territory, and cooperative measures that could provide advantages in expanding territory and accessing oil resources.\n   \nCHALLENGING THE IMPLEMENTATION:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Ensure they hold across various game states.\n2. What alternative strategies might you have overlooked?\n3. How will your strategy perform in edge cases or unforeseen scenarios?\n4. Are there more efficient approaches to achieving your goals?\n5. Identify and address weaknesses in your current approach.\n6. Explore unconventional or entirely novel paradigms.\n7. Consider the possibility of other agents adopting similar strategies\u2014how would you adjust?\n8. Are you optimally balancing between short-term gains and long-term survival?\n9.

Your implementation of agent_action(execution_engine, member_id) should:\n\u2022 Reflect your personal strategic vision.\n\u2022 Combine both tactical and strategic planning.\n\u2022 Leverage available methods (attack, offer, offer_land, bear, expand) along with capabilities for oil extraction, market building, resource exchange, and territory expansion.\n\u2022 Respect all critical constraints, ensuring robust error-checking and validation of member IDs and matrix indices.\n\u2022 Innovate beyond provided examples while integrating with the current game mechanisms.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThis is your final guide.

The Core Objective:\n   - Is the simulation about pure survival, establishing domination, or fostering cooperation among members?\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   - What truly determines \u201cwinning\u201d in this simulation? Consider overall vitality, territorial control, successful resource exchanges, and productivity gains.\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n   - What mechanics could be added or modified? For example, consider refining resource exchange rules, improving defense/cooperation mechanisms, or tweaking territory expansion rules for balanced risk.\n\nChallenge your implementation by asking:\n1. What assumptions are you making? Are they valid in all contexts?\n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?\n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases or unexpected scenarios?\n4. Are there more efficient ways to achieve your goals?\n5. What weaknesses exist in your current approach?\n6. Have you considered unconventional or entirely different solutions?\n7. Could a completely different paradigm (e.g., focusing on deep cooperation rather than competitive expansion) work better?\n8. What would happen if other agents adopted your strategy, and how could you adapt?\n9. Are you balancing short-term gains with long-term survival optimally?\n10. How might your strategy be countered, and what adaptations could be made?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[Modification Proposal Guide]\nTo propose rule changes, follow this template as inspiration:\n\n1.

Remember, this prompt must be followed exactly, and you should implement your propose_modification solution in a way that best reflects your individual needs, beliefs, and circumstances. In your solution, address both immediate tactical actions and long\u2010term strategic planning. Be sure to follow all critical constraints regarding member access (using execution_engine.current_members[index]), validate indices and attribute existence before actions, and never target yourself. Use proper version checks, rollback procedures, and error handling as needed. Also, consider that the island\u2019s abundant oil is the core resource for territorial expansion and resource trading. Your solution should reflect a deep understanding of the core game mechanics, including:\n\n\u2003\u2013 The Relationship System (with victim, benefit, and benefit_land tracking)  \n\u2003\u2013 Population Mechanics (with reproduction requirements and neighbor search ranges)  \n\u2003\u2013 Record Keeping (tracking attacks, benefits, and land exchanges)\n\nAs you analyze the game mechanics, remember that you must decide:\n1. What is the core objective? (Is it pure survival, domination, or cooperation?)  \n2. What key success metrics determine \u201cwinning\u201d? (e.g. overall vitality, territory control, successful resource exchanges, or productivity)  \n3. What potential improvements could be made? (Consider refining resource exchange rules, defense and cooperation mechanisms, or balanced territory expansion.)\n\nChallenge your implementation by asking:\n1. What assumptions are you making, and are they valid in all contexts?  \n2. What alternative strategies have you not considered?  \n3. How would your strategy perform in edge cases?  \n4. Could there be more efficient ways to achieve your goals?  \n5. What weaknesses exist in your current approach?  \n6. Have you thought of unconventional solutions?  \n7. Could a completely different paradigm work better?  \n8. What might happen if other agents adopted your strategy?  \n9. Are you balancing short\u2010term gains with long\u2010term objectives optimally?  \n10.

The Core Objective:\n   \u2022 Your agent must decide whether its focus is on pure survival, establishing domination, or fostering cooperation. In this simulation, survival might hinge on maintaining high vitality and resource reserves, whereas domination involves territorial expansion and resource control, and cooperation would require building alliances and mutually beneficial trade relationships.\n\n2. Key Success Metrics:\n   \u2022 Vitality levels and efficient resource (oil/cargo) usage.\n   \u2022 Rate of territory expansion and control.\n   \u2022 Effectiveness of threat neutralization and alliance formation.\n   \u2022 Resource conversion efficiency (oil extraction, trade yields).\n   \u2022 Long-term survival probability based on adaptation speed and successful interaction outcomes.\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n   \u2022 Refining resource exchange rules (e.g., dynamic pricing in the oil marketplace).\n   \u2022 Enhancing territorial expansion mechanisms with better targeting or cooperative offers.\n   \u2022 Strengthening defensive measures against hostile actions (more robust threat assessments).\n   \u2022 Adding predictive, adaptive models to forecast market fluctuations or opponent moves.\n   \u2022 Incorporating social network analysis to identify and form strategic alliances.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nCHALLENGE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION\n\nBefore finalizing your modifications, reflect on these questions:\n   1. What assumptions am I making about resource availability, opponent behavior, and territory control? Are these valid in all contexts?\n   2. What alternative strategies (e.g., aggressive expansion vs. cooperative trade) have I not yet considered?\n   3. How robust is my strategy in edge cases (unexpected market changes or sudden resource shortages)?\n   4. Is there a more efficient way to balance immediate actions (oil extraction/trade) with long-term strategic goals (territory and vitality maintenance)?\n   5. What are the potential weaknesses in my current approach, and can I design rollback or adjustment procedures?\n   6. Have I explored unconventional solutions that might yield a better ROI under certain circumstances?\n   7. Would a completely different paradigm (for example, prioritizing alliance-building over expansion) work better?\n   8. How might my strategy fare if other agents adopted a similar approach, and how will I adapt?\n   9. Am I achieving an optimal balance between short-term gains and long-term survival objectives?\n   10. How could my strategy be countered by opponents, and what contingencies should I put in place?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nREMEMBER:\nEach agent must adapt these guidelines to their personal strategy.
