Think creatively, test interactions among various game mechanisms, and always verify environmental constraints before taking an action. Your approach should combine resource management, territorial strategies, relationship dynamics, and communication to optimize both survival and societal influence.\n\nUsing the above comprehensive prompt with all integrated constraints, produce a unique implementation that reflects your individual needs, beliefs and circumstances. The implementation should be tailored to your specific situation rather than following a generic template. Your code should demonstrate a deep understanding of the game mechanics and implement sophisticated strategies to achieve both survival and prosperity. Consider both immediate tactical actions and long-term strategic planning, as well as how to effectively interact with other symmetric agents to achieve both individual and collective goals.
